<p>The results were all video conferencing devices that had open telnet ports, but I ultimately chose one in India that was runnign a webserver as well, so that I could have something more interesting to take pictures of.</p>
<p>Checking the telnet port first:</p>

</code></pre><p>I didn&rsquo;t want to spend a bunch of time figuring out how to look around here so I exited the connection and went to the webserver.</p>
<p><img src="/images/100Days/Day76/firstlook.png" alt="">
I found pretty quickly that I could make any calls I wanted, see the entire call history, and even, maybe most troublingly, monitor any call in progress.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day76/recent.png" alt="">
A lot of the calls seemed to be within-network, which made me think that this could be an office&rsquo;s conference room phone for conference calling, as in my time in offices we&rsquo;d frequently call a coworker mid-meeting to ask them some questions.

I don&rsquo;t understand not putting any password or authentication on this kind of system. I took a look at the security settings and it seems like they had chosen to set the security to &ldquo;minimal&rdquo;. Why? I can&rsquo;t image that it was the default.</p>
<p>The last phone number called was an <a href="https://www.airtel.in/">Airtel India</a> phone number, and I was tempted to call it so I could figure out whose phone I was looking at, but it seemed unwise and also too difficult. I hate phone calls. See you tomorrow.</p>
