<p>Today I saw a top search for something called &ldquo;GraphQL&rdquo;. Taking the bait on the unknown, I started looking.</p>

<h2 id="a-startup-named-zipline-s-api-testing-staging-space-on-184-169-231-191">A Startup Named Zipline&rsquo;s API Testing Staging Space on 184.169.231.191</h2>

<p>The first thing I noticed about GraphQL&rsquo;s distribution on Shodan was that it was all in the US. The second was that it was, by a huge margin, all in Ashburn, Virginia. After doing a quick google search I figured out that this is certainly because <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-business/wp/2014/03/05/why-ashburn-va-is-the-center-of-the-internet/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.aad8cd0d8ec8">Amazon has so many datacenters there</a>, and every GraphQL service seemed to be running on an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2 instance</a>. After doing a little more Googling I found that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL">GraphQL</a> is an API development tool and has two major IDEs: <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql">GraphiQL</a> and <a href="https://www.prisma.io/blog/introducing-graphql-playground-f1e0a018f05d/">GraphQL Playground</a>. These IDEs run in the browser, much like Jupyter Notebooks, and, when running on an Amazon EC2 instance, allow you to test and develop your server&rsquo;s API&hellip; from anywhere. Unfortunately it seems that if you aren&rsquo;t careful that means that I can test and write your API from anywhere too! I picked one of the few IPs that wasn&rsquo;t in Ashburn, this one in San Jose, hoping that it would belong to a goofy startup.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day12/graphql.png" alt="" />
They were running the GraphiQL IDE on this IP, just off of port 443, the https port. Now you&rsquo;ll see there in that screencapture I was trying to figure out how to make a query in GraphQL, and I wasn&rsquo;t choosing &ldquo;topInfluencer&rdquo; at random. GraphiQL will either autocomplete or give suggestions for terms if you hit control+space, so I found it pretty easy to start figuring out a bit about their API based on the autosuggestions it was giving me. I had more help, this coming from the IP&rsquo;s SSL certificate (remember that this is running off of port 443, so it has an https certificate - which unfortunately for them wasn&rsquo;t working which gave me the idea to check it).</p>

<pre><code>SSL Certificate

        Subject: CN=*.staging.zipline.co
</code></pre>

<p>You can see from that last line there that this certificate is under something called staging.zipline.co. Checking out zipline.co&hellip;
<img src="/images/100Days/Day12/zipline.png" alt="" />
Yes!! A goofy startup, just like I dreamed of. So what do they do?
<img src="/images/100Days/Day12/ziplineabout.png" alt="" />
Oh uh&hellip; okay
<img src="/images/100Days/Day12/ziplineabout2.png" alt="" />
Yeah okay so they connect brands to influencers to hawk their wares on Youtube, Instagram etc. Armed with this knowledge I felt free to spend as much time as I needed to figure out how to make a successful API call. And I did! Zipline is helping influencers sell products like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  &quot;data&quot;: {
    &quot;products&quot;: [
      {
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Bikini Prep Package&quot;,
        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;With this package I will be your all access coach for your bikini competition. We will always be in close contact and I will be available to you via text/phone and e-mail. I am very passionate about competing in the bikini division and if this is your first competition I will teach you everything there is to know about competing. I will help you decide which organization is best for you to compete in and I will help you decide on a show. I will provide your diet and exercise program. You will check in with me weekly via e-mail and provide me with weekly and sometimes bi-weekly progress pictures. I will make adjustments to your diet and exercise program as necessary. I will help you with your suit selection, and give my recommendations on your tan, hair and make-up (as I am also a licensed cosmetologist.) I will provide 2 posing lessons via skype. If you live local I will meet with you in person. Additional posing sessions are available for additional fees. If you live local I also recommend getting together with me weekly or bi-weekly for one on one training sessions (also at an additional fee.) I will provide you with your a peak week plan, as well as everything you need to know and do the day of your competition. I would love to be your coach, lets get started!&quot;,
        &quot;price&quot;: 297,
        &quot;opportunities&quot;: [],
        &quot;orders&quot;: []
      }
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And uh like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  &quot;data&quot;: {
    &quot;products&quot;: [
      {
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Trumps Enemies&quot;,

          },
          {
            &quot;id&quot;: &quot;758&quot;,
            &quot;description&quot;: &quot;&quot;

        ],
        &quot;opportunities&quot;: [],
        &quot;orders&quot;: []
      }
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And um this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  &quot;data&quot;: {
    &quot;products&quot;: [
      {
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Dangerous&quot;,

        ],
        &quot;orders&quot;: []
      }
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Read over that last description again. Is &ldquo;controversy old&rdquo; supposed to be&hellip; controversial?? Yeah so basically they&rsquo;re scum. And they&rsquo;re the kind of scum that leaves their API open with user accounts and emails visible. Whoops! See you tomorrow.</p>
