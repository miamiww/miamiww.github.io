			<p>A quick cam day today because I&rsquo;m a busy bee. I found a search awhile back for &ldquo;Auther: Steven Wu&rdquo;. Yes with the typo. It seems that Steven Wu wrote some server software for networked cameras back in maybe 2009 that is now used in a few different camera brands, all of which allow for snapshots to be taken without a password even if the video feed itself requires a password.</p>
<h2 id="trendnet-camera-on-19568183190">TRENDnet Camera on 195.68.183.190</h2>
<p>Most of the cameras that this search turns up are in Japan and most seemed to be in parking lots. Since there were a couple of thousand results, all of which were accessible, there was a fair amount of variety. I picked one in Moscow that appeared to be of a clothing store, complete with a few shoppers. This one was manufactured by a company called <a href="%5BTRENDnet%5D(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRENDnet)">TRENDnet</a>.

I was able to see a single still image from the camera that updated each time I reloaded the website. The rest of the features required a password. Interesting design choice. Occasionally when I reloaded the image would be completely glitched out.</p>
<p>Tantalizingly, the name of the store seems to be on that back wall, but I couldn&rsquo;t make it out. That&rsquo;s probably for the best. See you tomorrow.</p>
