<p>In honor of my spending about six hours on an airplane today I decided to search Shodan for &ldquo;satellite&rdquo; and, giving myself over to fate, pick the first result without looking at it.</p>

<h2 id="the-email-server-of-a-long-defunct-conference-at-163-44-163-77">The Email Server of a Long Defunct Conference at 163.44.163.77</h2>

<p>Since I was inspired by the fact that my airplane is being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viasat,_Inc.">serviced by satellite internet</a> I was of course hoping that I would find the IP for <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-communication-satellites-have-ip-addresses-If-so-what-are-they">a real actual space satellite</a>, though I suspected I was more likely to find someone&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.dish.com/internet/">satellite internet router or satellite dish</a>. Needless to say my first check on this IP got me very excited.</p>

<pre><code>👻🌵🔮 $ host 163.44.163.77
77.163.44.163.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer ip015.space-x-vie.net.
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;Space X! They make satellites!&rdquo; I think, <a href="https://www.alphr.com/space/1008632/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Starlink-internet">quickly starting to poke around as much as possible</a>. Unexpectedly I found that every single port is opened, all 65000ish (note I later figured out this is because <code>nmap</code> was getting interfered with on the airline wifi - can&rsquo;t figure out how though). Seems unlikely for a satellite. They also appear to be in Tokyo, although I can&rsquo;t imagine a satellite would actually say it is in &ldquo;space&rdquo;. So I tried going to and then port mapping space-x-vie.net but they didn&rsquo;t seem to exist, which is when I tried <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101201080921/http://www.space-x-vie.net:80/s">Internet Archive</a>.</p>

Space-x Vienna was a conference in Vienna on design for the visually impaired that ran twice, in 2010 and 2013. It had a global scope and attendance but seemed to be hosted primarily by Japanese organizations. Their website went dark back in 2016, so why was there an IP associated with them still hanging around. And not just one.</p>

<p>It looks like they have 17 total still up and associated with them (all named ip001-ip017) and they are all running email servers, all with every port open. Why? And if the Space X thing was just a red herring for satellites, how did they show up in my search?</p>

<p>Acutally I was able to answer that second question. Since <code>host</code> indicates that they are all running email, I thought I&rsquo;d check port 25, which is a frequently used SMTP port for email. Netcatting to that port gives the following result:</p>

<pre><code>👻🌵🔮 $ nc 163.44.163.77 25
220 st014.satellite-mail.net ESMTP unknown
</code></pre>

<p>I checked every IP and they are all connected to st014.satellite-mail.net. What&rsquo;s that you might ask? A reasonable question.</p>

<pre><code>👻🌵🔮 $ host st014.satellite-mail.net
st014.satellite-mail.net has address 150.95.138.218
st014.satellite-mail.net mail is handled by 10 st014.satellite-mail.net.
👻🌵🔮 $ host ip001.space-x-vie.net
ip001.space-x-vie.net has address 150.95.138.218
ip001.space-x-vie.net mail is handled by 10 ip001.space-x-vie.net.
</code></pre>

<p>It turns out it is ip001.space-x-vie.net! So it&rsquo;s 16 IPs doing email all off of the first IP, which is doing email off of itself. Maybe? Who knows anymore in this wacky messed up world. See you tomorrow.</p>

<p>PS if you want to see what a traceroute to Google looks like on an airplane I have got the goods for you.</p>
