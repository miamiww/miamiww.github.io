<p>I&rsquo;m busy preparing for a trip today and running errands so a quick one today. I found another Steven Wu webcam entirely by accident, just browsing Shodan&rsquo;s webserver snapshots (see day 38 if Steven Wu doesn&rsquo;t ring a bell). I like the Steven Wu cameras.

<p>The camera&rsquo;s webserver is running on port 81. Specifically what interested me about this webcam was its area of focus.

Why would anyone want a video feed of this specific angle of this sidewalk? If it&rsquo;s a security camera it won&rsquo;t help much if you can&rsquo;t see most peoples&rsquo; faces. Maybe it&rsquo;s a camera for pedestrian appreciation.

Wouldn&rsquo;t that be nice. Maybe there is a walking club, or a shoe appreciation society. Maybe a group lives in this area and they wear little tags on their shoes, and their friends and relatives check in on this camera hoping to catch a glimpse of a familiar foot.

Maybe it&rsquo;s a researcher, an urban planner, doing a study on pedestrian traffic, just on this particular sidewalk. There might be a data logger attached, the data could be capture via other means, but the research team thought it&rsquo;d be cute if they could check in and peep at their spot of pavement.

Maybe, though, it&rsquo;s just someone&rsquo;s driveway. Maybe the camera got bent, and nobody&rsquo;s checked it in awhile. Maybe a homeowner set it up years ago and forgot about it, the house has been sold, the new owners don&rsquo;t know the IP. No eager shoe enthusiasts. No one hoping to spot their friends and relatives. No wistful researchers.

We&rsquo;ll never know. See you tomorrow.</p>
