			<p>There&rsquo;s been a flurry of interesting recently shared searches on Shodan recently and I&rsquo;m just catching up with them. Today I looked into one for <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pis</a> running SSH that was just &ldquo;port:22 &ldquo;raspbian&rdquo;&rdquo;. There are almost 100,000 results which I think goes to show just how popular these tiny computers are.</p>

<p>I picked a result in Germany because I saw that in addition to SSH it was also running a webserver on 443. All that webserver was hosting though was the word &ldquo;home&rdquo;.

The SSL certificate though had a bit more information.

home.jedemenge-it.de does indeed resolve to our IP address. jedemenge-it.de is entirely different however, so I think that the home. is a <a href="https://www.pickaweb.co.uk/kb/cname-can-use-domain/">CNAME</a>.</p>
<pre><code>üëªüåµüîÆ $ host jedemenge-it.de
jedemenge-it.de has address 95.143.172.176
jedemenge-it.de mail is handled by 1 lupus.uberspace.de.
</code></pre><p>jedemenge-it.de itself is someone&rsquo;s personal website, almost certainly the owner of the Pi.</p>

Looks like they do freelance web development and design. Pretty fun. And they are hosted by a company called UBER SPACE, which might be the best/worst webhost name I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>See you tomorrow.</p>
