<p>Real tough one today. I found a search for <a href="https://www.downloads.siemens.com/download-center/d/SAPHIR-ACX32-Hardware-Description_29538_hq-en.pdf?mandator=ic_bt&amp;segment=HQ&amp;fct=downloadasset&amp;pos=download&amp;id1=29538">Siemen&rsquo;s Saphir HVAC control systems</a>, and four hours later I was installing a Windows virtual machine.</p>

<h2 id="hvac-scada-system-on-5-2-229-60">HVAC SCADA System on 5.2.229.60</h2>

<p>The search itself was for &ldquo;wince Content-Length: 12581&rdquo;. Many of the results on Shodan were in Romania, and so I picked one in Romania. It was running a webserver on 80.

This is a pretty cool design for a SCADA opening page. It looks a bit like a crossword. Only the Open RMS and Open Treeview links were active.

The remote monitoring system gave me a lot of access.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day79/config.png" alt="" />
I could change the password, change what access rights were for different users, upload my own files, upload my own programs, set up my own monitoring.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day79/processes.png" alt="" />
<img src="/images/100Days/Day79/files.png" alt="" />
That&rsquo;s all well and good. I decided to check out treeview, and that&rsquo;s where the trouble began.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day79/treeview.png" alt="" />
Lots of tantalizing things to click on. I really wanted to see those statistics. But whatever I clicked on I got the following error.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day79/java.png" alt="" />
Now, most modern browsers have gotten rid of java <a href="https://jaxenter.com/clock-ticking-java-browser-plugin-will-deprecated-soon-131546.html">many years ago</a>, the one exception being good old Internet Explorer. Naturally IE only runs on Windows, and I&rsquo;m sure you get where this is going at this point. Before I tried installing Windows, however, I tried several other more sensible options.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I tried this weird thing that Microsoft lets you do where you <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2015/10/19/use-internet-explorer-11-mac-os-x-easy/#comments">Remote Desktop to access Internet Explorer 11 from Windows but atop OS X</a>. I stopped because I didn&rsquo;t want to have to make a Microsoft account.</p></li>

<li><p>I installed Java 8 Developer Kit (very outdated) so that I could get a program called <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1394999/how-do-i-run-java-applets">appletviewer</a> that would allow me to download Java applets meant for a browser from their source and run them in their own Java runtime. Unfortunately even though I could download and run the applet, it was requesting data which my local applet didn&rsquo;t know how to find, so it didn&rsquo;t display anything.</p></li>

<li><p>I installed a four year old version of Firefox that allowed java plugins. It nearly worked.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day79/java2.png" alt="" />
However, it gave me an error because my Java security settings were too high to run applets from an unknown source. It said I could whitelist the source or change my security settings in the Java Control Panel. Where is the Java Control Panel? It hasn&rsquo;t existed in the last 3 versions of OSX. I then tried to change the security settings via editing Java&rsquo;s own configuration files, but couldn&rsquo;t find where it was setting them.</p></li>

<li><p>I tried installing an old version of Firefox on my Kali Linux VM. I couldn&rsquo;t remember the right <code>tar</code> flags I needed to install it, and didn&rsquo;t have the confidence that I wouldn&rsquo;t encounter the same problem as I had on OSX, so I didn&rsquo;t end up trying too hard.</p></li>

<li><p>I downloaded a Windows VM. The download took two hours, and by the time it was done the host wasn&rsquo;t up anymore. I don&rsquo;t know why it would have gone down considering that it was the control system for what I assume was a building&rsquo;s HVAC, but now we&rsquo;ll never know.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Lesson learned: always have Windows already installed. See you tomorrow.</p>
