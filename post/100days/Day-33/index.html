<p>Most of the servers seemed to be mail servers, but some of them were running webpages. I picked the first one I found that was running a web page.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day32/media.png" alt="">
The website is clearly meant for an international audience as it comes not only in Korean but also with translations to Russian, English, Chinese, French, and Spanish. After looking around I figured out that the purpose of this site is to collect patriotic pictures and videos of various aspects of North Korean life.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day32/supremeleader2.png" alt="">
There are many many many photo albums of Kim Jong Un.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day32/kimandxi.png" alt="">
Here&rsquo;s a picture of Kim Jung Un meeting with Xi Jinping I remember seeing on the South Korean TV station a bunch of times way back on day 24! I wonder if they got it from here? Or maybe all of these political meeting photos all kind of look the same.</p>
<p>The website also has about 100 videos that vary in content from &ldquo;check out this cool mountain&rdquo; to &ldquo;we the Korean people are soul bound to follow the Party down the only road into the future&rdquo;.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day32/mediaA.png" alt="">
Quite a few of the videos are extremely long (15+ minutes) patriotic songs. Again I could tell that these videos were clearly meant for an international audience, as they had english subtitles and frequent asides to give context.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day32/mediaB.png" alt="">
Some of the tourist-focused videos were really interesting. I found myself watching them for almost two hours.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day32/videostills.png" alt="">
There are videos about beaches, patriotic dogs, military factories, military airplanes, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Pueblo_(AGER-2)">US navy boat that the North Koreans captured from the United States in 1968 that has since been turned into a museum</a>, memorials of The War, the 38th parallel, US imperialism, fish pickling factories, special babies, a water park, and more. Many of them take the form of song.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day32/uncloak.png" alt="">
It&rsquo;s kitschy for sure, but I find it greatly unsettling.</p>
<p>The web page is called &ldquo;Media Ryugyong&rdquo; but when trying to search for it I at first only found information about a North Korean hotel named Ryugyong, that&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryugyong_Hotel">apparently been under construction since 1987 and has the Guinnes world record for largest uninhabited building</a>. After looking a little harder I found that it&rsquo;s listed as one of <a href="https://nkinternet.wordpress.com/websites/">only a handful of publicly accessible North Korean webpages</a>, but with very little English-language information available beyond that. I did find that it was made by a company called <a href="https://www.northkoreatech.org/2018/10/10/north-korea-launches-an-internet-portal/">Ryugyong Computer</a>, but then I couldn&rsquo;t find any information about that company.</p>
<p>I was a little curious about how exactly I&rsquo;m connecting to this website. Physical cables lead from my home all the way there, and I read that the only link to the internet outside of North Korea is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_in_North_Korea#International_Internet_access">a cable between Pyongyang and Dandong in China</a>. I checked traceroute to see if I could get a complete picture of the trip.</p>

</code></pre><p>Clearly I couldn&rsquo;t, but 219.158.39.42 at least seems to be in China. At least that&rsquo;s something. See you tomorrow.</p>
