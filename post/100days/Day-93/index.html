<p>I picked the very first result, in Brazil. So it&rsquo;s not very interesting in some senses, it&rsquo;s just running a telnet port on 9000. But you can connect and look around and stuff. It&rsquo;s all read-only. Trying to figure out what it was exactly got me on this <a href="https://rdot.org/forum/archive/index.php/t-6-p-14.html">Russian linux forum</a> which is really not where I want to be.</p>
<p>See you tomorrow.</p>
