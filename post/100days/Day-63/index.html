<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of hubbub in the infosec world the past couple of days because the NSA released one of their reverse engineering tools, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nsa-ghidra-open-source-tool/">Ghidra, as an open source toolkit</a>. This is huge news because the closest tool in functionality, <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/">IDA Pro</a>, is $1200 a year for a license, but also raised a question: would you trust software from the NSA, even if it&rsquo;s hosted on Github?

I&rsquo;m starting with this preamble because of a default setting in Ghidra. If you run the software in &ldquo;debug mode&rdquo;, by default it starts running a server on port 18001 that allows anyone to make a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/nsa-release-ghidra-a-free-software-reverse-engineering-toolkit/">tcp connection and execute code remotely over the internet</a>. Whoops?</p>

<h2 id="global-mastermind-securities-on-202-82-115-202">Global Mastermind Securities on 202.82.115.202</h2>

<p>I ran a search on Shodan for anything running port 18001. Turns out that&rsquo;s a great way to find everything that has every port open running a service on every port, like the website I found on day 41. I looked through all 500 results and I&rsquo;m not sure I found anyone who was running Ghidra insecurely. I was expecting to see a result that looked like a &ldquo;<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/troubleshoot/introclientissues005.html">Java Debug Wire Protocol</a>&rdquo; service, which is a Java debugger, but nothing with 18001 looked like it was doing a Java debugger. But I did find a few interesting things.</p>

<p>One of the IP addresses not running a mirrored service on every port was running a webserver on 80 and 443, and then the 18001 service. Both of the webservers gave 403 no authentication errors, but 443 did have an ssl certificate with a domain name attached.

<p>Let&rsquo;s check that url real quick.</p>

<pre><code>➜  ~ host trade.globalmsec.com
trade.globalmsec.com has address 202.82.115.239
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s not quite the IP address we are looking at, but it&rsquo;s close. Now checking all the nearby IPs, all the IP addresses between 202.82.115.193 and 202.82.115.235 are 403 forbiddens with ssl certificates set to names that sound like online trade platforms. Here&rsquo;s a list of a few of my favorites:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>www.onlinetrade.hss.com.hk</p>

<p>online.gwfg.com.hk</p>

<p>ayers.com.hk</p>

<p>www.kuentaisec.com.hk</p>

<p>etrade.shunloongsec.com</p>

<p>etrade2.ccnew.com.hk</p>

<p>etrade.conrad-is.com.hk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now as far as I can tell these are all under the provenance of separate, distinct companies. So why are all of these financial trading services lumped together in the same IP range? I have no idea. Maybe they are all running out of the same server farm in the Hong Kong stock exchange.</p>

<p>Getting back to our original IP address, I checked out globalmsec.com
<img src="/images/100Days/Day63/globalmsec.png" alt="" />
They seem like a lovely financial services company. Just look at that skyline! With a name like Global Mastermind, how can you not just give them all your investment capital? Now what really caught my attention though is the little &ldquo;Online Trade Login&rdquo; in the top right corner. So I clicked.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day63/trade.png" alt="" />
Aha! The url I want. And now I know probably what I need to append to the IP address to get around the 403, all that /mts.web/ stuff.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day63/ip.png" alt="" />
And there you go. Interestingly this doesn&rsquo;t work for 202.82.115.239, which instead claims to belong to ayers.com.hk.</p>

<p>So maybe there is a conspiracy after all. See you tomorrow.</p>
