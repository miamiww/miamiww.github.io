<p>Another boring day on the shared searches. I decided to search for IPs with &ldquo;dev environment&rdquo; in the title, hoping to find something good.</p>

<h2 id="ace-attorney-online-on-163-172-128-52">Ace Attorney Online on 163.172.128.52</h2>

<p>Many of the results were pretty interesting and I think it&rsquo;s a fruitful search overall, but one result in France stood out to me.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day49/firstlook.png" alt="" />
It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;developer environment&rdquo; for a webpage running on port 8080 dedicated to fan-made versions of the popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Attorney">Ace Attorney</a> games. In each Ace Attorney game you play as a lawyer who has to &ldquo;solve the case&rdquo;, they seem to be a bit adventure and a bit puzzle solving with very low legal realism. In some ways it&rsquo;s an inversion of a detective story, the game is usually won once you present evidence that you&rsquo;ve uncovered that proves your client&rsquo;s innocence. From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The story follows Phoenix Wright, a rookie defense attorney who attempts to have his clients declared &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There have been 11 official versions of this game but on this website they&rsquo;ve made way more, using all the assets from the official games to make their own, and sometimes make their own assets. Well I should say, they are doing that on the real version of the website, on port 80. 8080 is a little sparse, I think they just use it to test the formatting of the page without any of the user-generated content.

<p>On the top you see the developer page, on the bottom is the live page.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day49/forums.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also forums (both in french and in english) and of course, the games themselves.

<img src="/images/100Days/Day49/gavin.png" alt="" />
<img src="/images/100Days/Day49/mia.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I played them a bunch. They&rsquo;re all over the map in terms of quality, some are just bizarre fanfictions, some try to be &ldquo;real&rdquo; games. I&rsquo;m amazed by the dedication, many of them have multiple installments and their own mini franchises. Some of them say they were in development for <em>over seven years</em>! It seems like a really passionate community.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day49/reddit.png" alt="" />
I found some stuff about it on Reddit. Seems like it&rsquo;s got a pretty big following among the Ace Attorney Fandom. The game assets are pretty simple so it makes sense that it&rsquo;d be easy to remix like this.</p>

<p>Attorney Online, the other site mentioned, looks pretty interesting also. But that&rsquo;s for another time. See you tomorrow.</p>
