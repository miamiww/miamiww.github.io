<p>I saw that someone was searching for quite a few different types of AV receivers today. I decided to look into one of their searches, this one for Yamaha receiver.</p>

<h2 id="yamaha-av-recievers-on-90-149-252-214">Yamaha AV Recievers on 90.149.252.214</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the typical use-case for remote control of an AV receiver is. Maybe if you run a cafe and you want to make sure your untrustworthy employees don&rsquo;t make the music too loud while you&rsquo;re out? I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s incredibly useful in certain situations, but I can&rsquo;t think of any off the top of my head. All of the Yamaha ones were running a webserver off port 80, so I picked one in Norway and took a look.

Amazing, I have complete control over the volume. I&rsquo;m also capable of flipping the &ldquo;PARTY MODE&rdquo; switch, likely with dire consequences for the immediate surroundings of this device. I could also turn the device off, but that would probably also cut off my connection. There&rsquo;s also a settings button.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day42/settings.png" alt="" />
Great, all the goodies. Probably the worst thing someone could do right off the bat is brick it, but if they had a malicious version of the firmware they could install that as well. Looks like this is a RX-A1030 model.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day42/discontinued.png" alt="" />
Which is now discontinued. A hymn for those lost, firmware eternally waiting for the next upgrade, never to arrive. I found the user manual, trying to understand why someone would want a device with remote internet control, but it was 150 pages, and I&rsquo;ve got like a life to live.</p>

<p>I did decide to give it an <code>nmap</code> to see if I could find anything else about it.</p>

<pre><code>👻🌵🔮 $ nmap 90.149.252.214

</code></pre>

<p>1024 is <a href="https://www.apple.com/airplay/">Apple Airplay</a>. That <a href="https://www.varonis.com/blog/what-is-upnp/">UPnP is open is a little unnerving</a>, and I couldn&rsquo;t find any reason why the receiver would need that service, though it seems that, <a href="https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=199774">based on some forum posts I found</a>, people configure it to talk over that port to connect to their media servers. Risky when you&rsquo;re putting that all over the internet! 50000 is a mystery, <a href="https://blog.webernetz.net/yamaha-r-n500-network-receiver-port-scan/">probably not one worth solving</a>.</p>

<p>Delightfully 8080 is a webserver running a single, beautiful page.

PRESENTATION PAGE. Completely blank other than that.</p>

<p>If only all websites were so well thought out. See you tomorrow.</p>
