<p>Today I saw a search for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol">Microsoft Remote Desktop protocol</a>. The search was for &ldquo;\x03\x00\x00\x0b\x06\xd0\x00\x00\x124\x00&rdquo;.

<h2 id="microsoft-remote-desktop-on-124-146-236-44">Microsoft Remote Desktop on 124.146.236.44</h2>

<p>There were several hundred thousand results, showing just how popular the remote desktop protocol is. I remember using it quite often in a job I had several years ago. Initially I thought of looking for my old company&rsquo;s system but that seemed kind of like a weird thing to be doing. So instead I looked for something funny. After trying a few, and downloading the Microsoft remote desktop viewer, I found a result in Japan.

Hah! Potty. This one didn&rsquo;t have anything else running and so I had to leave it at that. Well based on the names I was able to figure out a bit more about what this probably was, but it got into doxing territory, so I stopped.</p>

<p>See you tomorrow.</p>
