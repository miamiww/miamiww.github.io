<p>Today I wanted to find a webcam but not because I needed an easy target, but rather so that I could find a webcam that would lead me to its precise location. I mulled about in Shodan&rsquo;s image viewer until I found an interesting result, and lo and behold, it&rsquo;s another webcam server made by Steven Wu (see days 38 and 47 if that name doesn&rsquo;t ring a bell). Thank you, Steven Wu, for your really terribly insecure webcam server.</p>

<h2 id="a-kino-on-87-128-13-137">A Kino on 87.128.13.137</h2>

<p>The result I picked was both appealing for what I saw through the webcam, but also for its Shodan-given location: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnenden">Winnenden, Germany</a>, a tiny town of 28,000. Now, for what I saw through the webcam.

Sure looks like a move theater lobby right? Now in a 28,000 person town, there couldn&rsquo;t be too many movie theaters right? Turns out that in Winnenden, there&rsquo;s only one, Olympia Kino (kino is German for movie theater).
<img src="/images/100Days/Day62/olympia.png" alt="" />
IP address location services are notoriously inaccurate, however, so how could I be sure that this was the one? I decided to give the IP address an <code>nmap</code> to see if I could get any info.</p>

<pre><code>➜  sandbox git:(master) ✗ nmap 87.128.13.137

<p>The webcam I was originally looking at was on port 82, so I decided to look at 81.

Another one of Steven Wu&rsquo;s finest, this time of what must be the building&rsquo;s electrical closet. Why put a webcam here? Maybe to monitor the knobs? Make sure they aren&rsquo;t turning themselves?</p>

<p>I was hoping 83 and 85 were webcams as well, but they were garden variety authentication logins. 443 had a less garden-variety login.

The router! Now as we all know the Lancom 1781VAW is <a href="https://www.lancom-systems.com/products/routers-vpn-gateways/business-vpn-routers/lancom-1781vaw/">the ideal choice for small and medium-sized businesses needing VPN networking and wireless connections for mobile clients</a>. I&rsquo;m not sure why they would need VPN networking, but they might have just chosen this router because Lancom seems to have <a href="https://wifinowevents.com/news-and-blog/leading-german-wi-fi-vendor-lancom-acquired-by-rohde-schwartz/">considerable market share for business routers in Germany</a>.</p>

<p>That leaves the VNC server, but unfortunately for me their VNC server is not wide open like the one I found all the way back on day 1.

Out of options on the network, I tried looking for images of the kino on social media to see if any matched up to the lobby view I was getting. I did find one picture of the Olympia Kino lobby.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day62/lobby2.png" alt="" />
Doesn&rsquo;t look a whole lot like the lobby I&rsquo;m seeing in the webcam, the floor is quite different and the door setup is different as well. I do see some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club-Mate">club mates</a> in the fridge.</p>

<p>For awhile I started looking around at all the movie theaters in nearby towns, but once I got through about a half dozen I decided it was a fool&rsquo;s errand. I may never know for sure what movie theater this was, and I just have to live with that. See you tomorrow.</p>
