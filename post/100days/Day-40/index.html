<h2 id="a-mystery-on-118249511">A Mystery on 118.24.95.11</h2>
<p>However I discovered this IP, I first arrived at what looked like a normal blog on port 8083.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day40/firstlook.png" alt="">
There is a very ~hacker~ image of a guy in ad hoody as the author&rsquo;s picture. However most of the content was empty and it had a lot of default posts with fake engagement. It reminded me of the unfinished blogs I saw on days 11 and 22. This one had a nice interactive HTML5 canvas for a background with some cool shapes. The canvas seemed to make my CPU go into overdrive though so I didn&rsquo;t leave the tab open for very long.</p>
<p>I saw that it was also running services on 80 and 443, classic website behavior. But it wasn&rsquo;t a website, as I found out. 80 wasn&rsquo;t actually hosting anything. 443 was, and had a certificate letting me know that the url for this page is &ldquo;swpuhelloworld.cn&rdquo; (now swpu could be Southwest Petroleum University, a Chinese University, but I didn&rsquo;t get anywhere with this line of investigation). But all it had on it was a JSON file, no HTML, no nothing.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day40/json.png" alt="">
If you look carefully you&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s a list of IP addresses, their location, and methods of logging into them. I got kind of freaked out seeing this. Clearly there was something deep going on here. First the guy in the hoodie in the blog and now this!!</p>
<p>Parsing through that JSON I found that there were three URLs being used as passwords: <a href="http://gggg.rocks">http://gggg.rocks</a>, <a href="http://www.darrenliuwei.com">www.darrenliuwei.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.sphard.com">www.sphard.com</a>. In addition there were references to addresses for these servers called &ldquo;ssurl&rdquo;. I would like to now say that it took me hours to discover what ssurl meant. Let&rsquo;s come back to those in a bit, and look first at those URLs.</p>
<h3 id="blue_7-on-ggggrocks">Blue_7 on gggg.rocks</h3>
<p>gggg.rocks is a Wordpress site with a single blog post.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day40/gggg.png" alt="">
It&rsquo;s a list of IP addresses with ssh login information for all of them and a link to a service that checks whether or not an IP address is blocked in China. Immediately I had a hunch: people are using these servers to get around the Chinese government&rsquo;s firewalls. The only other thing in the post  a link to Blue_7&rsquo;s <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> chatroom.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day40/telegram.png" alt="">
What&rsquo;s Blue_7? The description there on their Telegram page says they are a &ldquo;tea drinking club&rdquo;. What&rsquo;s Telegram? It&rsquo;s a chat app that requires you install it before you can login to a chatroom, and advertises itself as heavily encrypted with a major emphasis on privacy and security. Messages in Telegram also &ldquo;self destruct&rdquo; after a user-defined time limit. My hunch is that Blue_7 is a group that sets up and disseminates information about these servers, like a hacking collective for getting around the government firewall. No I didn&rsquo;t get Telegram and join their group. I wanted to but I had other pressing things to look into.</p>
<h3 id="wwwdarrenliuweicom-and-wwwsphardcom"><a href="http://www.darrenliuwei.com">www.darrenliuwei.com</a> and <a href="http://www.sphard.com">www.sphard.com</a></h3>
<p>These two blogs are virtually identical and belong to the same man.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day40/darren.png" alt="">
He makes a lot of tech instructional videos and has several thousand Youtube followers. Based on reading comments on his Youtube videos I think he has duplicate blogs because one of his blog urls got banned in China, maybe because he was participating in this kind of firewall-evading. As what seems to be a total red herring for me he has exactly the same blog theme as the original blog that I found, down to the interactive background canvas that eats up my computer&rsquo;s CPU.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day40/interactive.png" alt="">
I assume now that the original blog I found probably just copied this guy&rsquo;s blog style.</p>
<h3 id="ssurl">ssurl</h3>
<p>My first hunch was &ldquo;secure shell url&rdquo;. Wrong. ssurl is not a commonly used acronym and is not truly Googalable, though that didn&rsquo;t stop me from trying.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day40/shadowsocks.png" alt="">
Finally I arrived here, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowsocks">Shadowsocks</a>. From Wikipedia: &ldquo;Shadowsocks is a free and open-source encrypted proxy project, widely used in mainland China to circumvent Internet censorship.&rdquo; Of course! Proxies! Somehow my brain was blocking out the word &ldquo;proxy&rdquo; and I had to reconstruct the idea in my own head before I could search for it. As I&rsquo;m sure you can now guess, ssurl stands for shadowsocks url and is the url created by a proxy server when running shadowsocks and is what it uses for tunneling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re wondering: how long exactly were you searching on Google? An hour? Two? Well I&rsquo;m here to say life is a little richer if some of the mysteries get left unsolved. See you tomorrow.</p>
