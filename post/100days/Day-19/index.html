			<p>Today I&rsquo;m staying with a friend whose partner has a pretty serious media server set up (with 64TB! of content), and I thought I&rsquo;d take a look to see if I could find it on Shodan. And sure enough I could!</p>
<h2 id="my-friends-media-server-on-104172240189">My Friend&rsquo;s Media Server on 104.172.240.189</h2>
<p>So I had previously seen a <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a> service running on an IP back on day 9, but I didn&rsquo;t investigate it too much because at the time I was focused on the irrigation system. When my friend was telling me about his setup it took quite a while to put two and two together and to realize that I had previously seen this service. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plex_(software)">Plex servers</a> are typically run on port 32400, and require an account and login to access, as Plex ties each individual server back to its own service via a client ID that it connects to when you visit the server&rsquo;s port in the browser. He gave me a pretty decent explanation but I still didn&rsquo;t fully follow how it both exists as a streaming web service and as the software for a self-hosted media server. Seems like a weird business model. But at least I got to see one in the flesh.</p>
<p>I did a port scan and did pen test everything (no vulnerabilities), but realized I felt a little too weird talking about everything on his network since I was able to verify it all by being on the network myself. It&rsquo;s one thing to make guesses about strangers, it&rsquo;s another to list all the things you see in your friend&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>That being said here are the results of <code>nmap</code>. You can see the media server down at 32400. Most everything else I was able to tie to something I saw on the network.</p>
<pre><code>üëªüåµüîÆ $ nmap -p- 104.172.240.189
