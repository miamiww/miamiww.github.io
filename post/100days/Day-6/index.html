<h3 id="yokohama-air-traffic-control-tower-on-1333415713">Yokohama Air Traffic Control Tower on 133.34.157.13</h3>
<p>Reading about them on Shodan it looks like the Q-Series logic controllers tend to run off ports 5006 or 5007. So I did a search for those open ports. Judging from the results it looks like the majority of these Mitsubishi controllers are in Japan, not surprising I suppose since Mitsubishi is a Japanese company. So I picked one of the first results. I&rsquo;ve been finding that <code>nmap</code> is a pretty good first go-to tool since, <code>host</code>, <code>whois</code>, and <code>nslookup</code> depend on DNS records, and quite a few things aren&rsquo;t on DNS.</p>
<pre><code>üëªüåµ‚ú®$ nmap -p- 133.34.157.13
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-01-09 20:32 EST
Nmap scan report for 133.34.157.13
Host is up (0.23s latency).
Not shown: 65529 filtered ports
PORT      STATE  SERVICE
21/tcp    open   ftp
23/tcp    closed telnet
80/tcp    open   http
502/tcp   open   mbap
5007/tcp  open   wsm-server-ssl
30301/tcp open   unknown

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1431.86 seconds
</code></pre><p>One interestingly bit, port 502 is running mbap which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus">Modbus</a> protocol for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication">serial communication</a>.</p>
<p>Very interestingly though port 80 is open even though I couldn&rsquo;t find anything about this IP on <code>nslookup</code>, meaning it&rsquo;s running something via http for a browser to interpret but doesn&rsquo;t have a URL. So taking a look via a browser&hellip;

I was pretty dumbfounded by what I was looking at. Yokohama Air Control Tower&hellip; as in Air Traffic Control? After looking around quite a bit, near as I can tell this is indeed a data logger for the facility management system for an air traffic control tower in Yokohama. I couldn&rsquo;t really find much about an airport in Yokohama, it seems that there isn&rsquo;t a major airport but there is a small airfield for private or government flights. It has an airport code, <a href="https://www.world-airport-codes.com/japan/yokohama-7799.html">YOK</a>, but you can&rsquo;t book a flight there, and travel guides all recommend flying into Tokyo&rsquo;s Haneda airport. There&rsquo;s also heliports&hellip; English language sources are scarce and I&rsquo;m not sure what to search for in Japanese to find out more.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day6/data.png" alt="">
But I can find out about the amount of power demand from this building&rsquo;s lighting and air conditioning. I&rsquo;m guessing that the other measurements have to do with water.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day6/data2.png" alt="">
It seems like I could actually make changes to things here but I resisted the urge to hit too many buttons. But I did find that they had conveniently left the telnet login on this web app.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day6/Telnet.png" alt="">
Whoops! Possibly that&rsquo;s why port 23 is closed.</p>
<p>Looking at the other obvious info on this web app, <a href="http://www.m-system.com/english/index.html">MSYSTEM</a> is a manufacturer of a variety of data loggers and logic controllers, and the DL8 is their series of web-based data loggers.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day6/MSeries.png" alt="">
So this wasn&rsquo;t what I had originally gone searching for, a Mitsubishi Q-Series. They must be using 5007 for something else.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day6/MSeries2.png" alt="">
Sure looks familiar so this is definitely what is behind this IP.</p>
<p>But why collect water quality levels in a seemingly nonexistent air traffic control tower? Who&rsquo;s really running this operation. See you tomorrow.</p>
