<p>Almost all the results I found for this search in Shodan were running off of port 3001 (the ones that weren&rsquo;t were on 9001), and tended to be in Russia, South Korea, or Ukraine. I chose one of the first IPs I found, this one from Caracas in Venezuela. I was initially pretty confused by what I was looking at when visiting it in a browser.

What exactly is going on here? It looks like terminal output, but in a browser. Someone is tracking speeds of their 11 Radeon GPUs for discreet jobs, but even after googling &ldquo;ETH: total speed&rdquo; it wasn&rsquo;t totally clear to me what I was seeing. This server had two other ports open: 2021 and 2022, but each of those just prompted logins when I tried to visit them.</p>
<pre><code>➜  sandbox git:(master) ✗ nmap 186.90.40.229 -Pn

<p>The main clue is the line</p>
<pre><code>New job from eth-us-west1.nanopool.org:9999
</code></pre><p><img src="/images/100Days/Day8/nanopool.png" alt="">
Visiting nanopool.org it was suddenly so clear: ethereum mining! <em>of course!</em> After <a href="https://blockonomi.com/how-to-dual-mine-ethereum-and-sia/">reading a guide</a> about how to mine ethereum it seems like miners join resource pools like nanopool in order to share their GPUs for greater overall reward, with only a small payout (1%) to the pool itself. And some of the <a href="https://github.com/nanopool">mining software on nanopool&rsquo;s github</a> had output screenshots that look just like the output I was seeing from my IP, meaning that it is likely running some of nanopool&rsquo;s mining software.

It seems like nanopool has quite the operation, with 44,226 miners, of which I had only found one.</p>
<p>One last point that is interesting here: from <code>nmap</code> I saw that the IP is registered under 186-90-40-229.genericrev.cantv.net. <a href="http://cantv.net/">CANTV</a> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CANTV">nationalized internet service of the Venezuelan government</a>. I tried to find if they were offering any cloud computing services, but I couldn&rsquo;t tell, meaning that this IP is probably connected to somebody&rsquo;s home, running a machine with 11 GPUs. That makes sense, since the costs of mining off of virtual machines might be prohibitive, unless nationalized internet costs are just that cheap.</p>
<p>But why AMD GPUs and not Nvidia? And how does this kind of pooling work? See you tomorrow.</p>
