<p>Kind of a weird one today. I didn&rsquo;t like any of the searches I&rsquo;d seen so I decided to search for anything that had &ldquo;production plant&rdquo; in the title.</p>

<h2 id="a-woodchem-production-plant-on-154-126-209-18">A Woodchem Production Plant on 154.126.209.18</h2>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure what I was looking for, but got several dozen results. I decided to pick one in South Africa.

On port 80 it was running a login for a <a href="https://www.dahuasecurity.com/">Dahua</a> Technology device. Dahua mostly makes surveillance products like cameras and patrol drones(!) but in researching them I also found that their products are infamous for <a href="https://www.hackread.com/bashlite-malware-linux-iot-ddos-botnet/">being used for botnets</a>.</p>

<p>There was also a service running on port 1723, I couldn&rsquo;t tell exactly what it was but in the banner it said:</p>

<pre><code>Firmware: 1
Hostname: Woodchem-production-plant-CRS
Vendor: MikroTik
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://mikrotik.com/">MikroTik</a> is a manufacturer of routers and other network devices that is <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/over-200-000-mikrotik-routers-compromised-in-cryptojacking-campaign">also well known</a> for <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-mikrotik-routers-are-snooping-on-user-traffic/">getting hacked</a>. So not the best sourcing from this possible woodchem production factory.
Woodchem by the way both seems to be <a href="http://www.woodchem.fr/en/">a conference</a> about the wood products industry and a <a href="https://www.kap.co.za/portfolio-posts/producing-at-higher-volumes/">company that has invested in South Africa</a>. After reading a few different press releases I think this factory that I found is likely in Piet Retief, run by a company called <a href="http://www.safripol.com/">Safripol</a>, which is a subsidiary of KAP Industrial Holdings Limited, a large industrial multinational.

There were several wood related factories in Piet Retief, as its main industry is timber, but I was able to figure out that it&rsquo;s probably this one, as seen from Google maps.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day48/factory.png" alt="" />
Their main output is urea-formaldehyde resin, which is then used in the manufacture of processed woods like particle boards.</p>

<p>I wonder where those particle boards go? See you tomorrow.</p>
