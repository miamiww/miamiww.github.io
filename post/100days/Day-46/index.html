<p>Someone was really looking for GPONs today, as I saw at least three searches for GPON related devices. What&rsquo;s a GPON you wonder? Let&rsquo;s find out together.</p>

<h2 id="vnpt-gpon-ont-on-14-161-15-80">VNPT GPON ONT on 14.161.15.80</h2>

<p>GPON stands for <a href="https://www.multicominc.com/solutions/technologies/gpon/">Gigabit Passive Optical Network</a>. Though the real details of how they work escape me, it seems that they are a commonly used device by ISPs to separate out cable traffic between customers, frequently referred to as the &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; between the ISP and the end customer. If you could follow your internet line out of your apartment you&rsquo;d might find that it attaches to one of these. They look like beefier home routers. I picked the first result I found on Shodan, this one from Vietnam.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day46/firstlook.png" alt="" />
It was running a web login on port 80. The title of the login page indicated that it was a GPON ONT, ONT standing for Optical Network Terminal, which I think means its a device to login to a GPON, again the descriptions online were deeply technical and assumed a lot of knowledge that I don&rsquo;t have. It was also running a telnet server on 23, and interestingly a DNS server on 53. That makes sense if it has to figure out where to send traffic. I decided to check <code>host</code>.</p>

<pre><code>➜  ~ host 14.161.15.80
80.15.161.14.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer static.vnpt.vn.
</code></pre>

<p>static.vnpt.vn, interestingly, does not follow back to the IP.</p>

<pre><code>➜  ~ host static.vnpt.vn
static.vnpt.vn has address 203.162.0.78
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNPT">VNPT</a> is the second biggest company in Vietnam, a government-owned telecom giant that services the country. Again it makes sense that an ISP is running this GPON.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day46/vnptb.png" alt="" />
I have a hunch that VNPT has just given static.vnpt.vn to all of its static IPs that it wants to keep track of, which would explain why I can&rsquo;t get back to the original IP address from the url.</p>

<p>I at least half confirmed this with <code>traceroute</code>. As you can see the last six IPs are all under static.vnpt.vn</p>

<pre><code>➜  ~ traceroute 14.161.15.80

<p>I tried to figure out what the device looked like. I went around on their website for awhile before ending up on <a href="http://www.vnpt-technology.vn/ViewDetailContentAction?categoryId=56&amp;contentId=304">this page</a>.

If you take a very close look at the bottom right of that image, you&rsquo;ll see that it is discussing GPONs. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look of the image of that device.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day46/GW240.png" alt="" />
Yes! It&rsquo;s called an iGate, model GW240, with the words &ldquo;GPON Optical Network Terminal&rdquo; written on its side.</p>

<p>Like I said, beefier router. See you tomorrow.</p>
