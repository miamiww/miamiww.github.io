			<p>Another IoT home device today. At this point I&rsquo;m picturing the people with these things basically having a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqGTtFIZm5Y&amp;t=65">Wallace and Gromit style</a> lifestyle (note: I do have a wifi plug and yes this is my lifestyle). This one was inspired by another search I didn&rsquo;t recognize, for &ldquo;Sonoff&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="a-sonoff-wifi-enabled-plug-on-8720184148">A Sonoff wifi enabled plug on 87.20.184.148</h2>
<p><a href="https://sonoff.itead.cc/en/">Sonoff is a company</a> that makes IoT plugs and switches, as well as a couple of models of IoT fans and light bulbs. What&rsquo;s interesting about Sonoff is that many of their cheapest switches are just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266">ESP8266 boards</a> with a casing, <a href="https://tzapu.com/sonoff-firmware-boilerplate-tutorial/">making them very</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@jeffreyroshan/flashing-a-custom-firmware-to-sonoff-wifi-switch-with-arduino-ide-402e5a2f77b">easy to hack</a>.
<img src="https://github.com/arendst/arendst.github.io/blob/master/media/sonoffbasic.jpg" alt="">
I just picked the first Sonoff that showed up in my Shodan search, in Italy. Shodan said it was running a web app on port 80, so I checked it out in a browser.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day15/mainmenu.png" alt="">
The firmware&rsquo;s out of date! Probably should get that taken care of. More interestingly there is a big old Toggle button calling out to be toggled. If it&rsquo;s a switch that probably turns the current on and off so I resisted.</p>
<p>Looking up Sonoff-Tasmota I found that it is a <a href="https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota">homebrewed version of the Sonoff firmware</a>, so this device is either a hacked Sonoff original or a <a href="https://community.blynk.cc/t/sonoff-clone-mini-esp8266-power-ac-relay-controller/9549/4">Sonoff clone running off of someone&rsquo;s ESP8266 board</a>. Let&rsquo;s check out that console!
<img src="/images/100Days/Day15/console.png" alt="">
Looks like it&rsquo;s mostly been taking commands via <a href="http://mqtt.org/">MQTT</a>. Looking more closely&hellip; there&rsquo;s the wifi name! &ldquo;Angelozzi&rdquo;. Well what could we do with that information? Check it on <a href="https://wigle.net/index">WiGLE</a> of course!
<img src="/images/100Days/Day15/wigle.png" alt="">
WiGLE is a global database of wifi and cell networks, promising &ldquo;All the networks. Found by Everyone.&rdquo; They tag SSID names and other information to latitude and longitudes. And yes it looks like they had six wifi networks named &ldquo;Angelozzi&rdquo;, three of which were in New Jersey, one in Canada, one in South Africa, and yes, one in Italy. In Bologna. Again I get the vertigo of overconnection.</p>
<p>I decided to give it an <code>nmap</code> just for good measure.</p>
<pre><code>üëªüåµüîÆ $ nmap -p-  87.20.184.148
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-01-18 12:33 PST
Nmap scan report for host148-184-dynamic.20-87-r.retail.telecomitalia.it (87.20.184.148)

</code></pre><p>As soon as I did though I noticed that something weird was happening on the console: the Sonoff had lost connection with whatever device had been MQTTing it?
<img src="/images/100Days/Day15/whoops.png" alt="">
What this because I&rsquo;d started flooding it with ping probes? Possibly? It seemed to be able to connect again once my scan was done. After a little fiddling around with these ports I found that the Sonoff device was talking with an <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">open source home automation system called Home Assistant</a>, which must be the device it&rsquo;s MQTTing to at 192.168.1.100, using <a href="https://mqtt.org/faq">the classic MQTT port of 1883</a>.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day15/homeassistant.png" alt="">
<a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/">It&rsquo;s probably running on a Raspberry Pi</a>. See you tomorrow.</p>
<p>PS here&rsquo;s my tavel traceroute, from Bru Coffee in LA to Bologna, Italy.</p>
