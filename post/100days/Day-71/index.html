<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">FTP</a> seems like an ancient technology but I had a job just a few years ago where we would use it all of the time, and I frequently use it to move files to my servers when I can&rsquo;t be bothered to remember the correct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy">scp</a> syntax. It turns out though that the newest Mac operating systems took out FTP from the built in software, so I had to reinstall it. They still have SFTP, which is the preferable protocol to use anyway, but since SFTP and FTP aren&rsquo;t actually interoperable, I needed the original model.</p>

</code></pre><p>Here is my amazing result after connecting (via port 21, the typical FTP port). Now oddly I couldn&rsquo;t get that much done, my list of commands seemed to be severely restricted as an anonymous user, I couldn&rsquo;t even use <code>ls</code>. So I instead opted to look around via the browser FTP protocol. First though I double checked that indeed the IP I had was the same URL that the FTP header above was directing me toward.</p>
<pre><code>üëªüåµüîÆ $ host 195.128.64.25
25.64.128.195.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer mirror.macomnet.NET.
</code></pre><p>Yup we are all good. Wait actually let&rsquo;s first see what macommet is.</p>

Great it&rsquo;s a Russian telecom, but why are they running an FTP server? Let&rsquo;s take a look.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day71/firstlook.png" alt="">
I&rsquo;m guessing from the timestamps that this server was set up back in 2008 but is still being used as of a couple of days ago. Now /bin/ and /etc/ are just where all of the commands you can use when logged into the server are. /pub/ is where all the good stuff is.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day71/pub.png" alt="">
It&rsquo;s a bunch of open source software! Kind of an amazing little collection actually. There&rsquo;s <a href="https://ctan.org/?lang=en">CTAN</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LyX">lyx</a> for your word processing, two kinds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD">BSD</a> operating systems, <a href="https://www.hirensbootcd.org/">Hiren&rsquo;s BootCD</a> for your hard drive backups, and the classic <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html">VLC</a>.</p>
<p>After wondering why this telecom had done this for a bit I noticed something I had missed before. The url had &ldquo;mirror&rdquo; in it! Of course, they were putting up open source software on an FTP server to help <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_website">spread access to the software and share bandwidth loads</a> with the open source projects, so that they wouldn&rsquo;t have to bear the cost of heavy download traffic themselves. This used to be more common, but bandwidth has gotten cheaper these days, you don&rsquo;t need so much community support like this anymore. Or maybe mirroring is still a big deal and I&rsquo;ve just gravitated away from the world of downloading a lot of open source software, with my Mac operating system that doesn&rsquo;t even have FTP.</p>
<p>See you tomorrow.</p>
