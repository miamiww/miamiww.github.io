<p>I saw someone searching for &ldquo;ICO&rdquo;. At first I thought maybe it had something to do with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ico">groundbreaking 2001 indie game</a>, but after browsing some links I realized that no, it meant <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/initial-coin-offering-ico.asp">&ldquo;Initial Coin Offering&rdquo;</a>, and yes this is another crypto thing.</p>

<h2 id="coincircle-s-icostats-tracker-on-165-227-6-170">CoinCircle&rsquo;s ICOStats Tracker on 165.227.6.170</h2>

<p>Most of the results on Shodan are websites and webservers, but I found one running on Digital Ocean that&rsquo;s just a web app running on port 3000.

The app is called ICO Stats, and appears to collect and display real time information about a whole lot of different &ldquo;coins&rdquo;. Digital coins, digital tokens, digital assets, what are these things? I believe I have a fairly decent grasp of the mechanics of creating them, but what I don&rsquo;t understand is how the market works and how value is being assigned. Is the demand just entirely speculation?
<img src="/images/100Days/Day29/performers.png" alt="" />
Look at that! There&rsquo;s a coin called NXT whose value has increased <em>173940%</em> in the past 4 years. That means that if you bought a single dollar of NXT in 2013 you would now have nearly <em>one hundred and seventy four thousand dollars</em> worth of it now. Crypto world feels like an entirely different vision of reality, one that makes me queasy and filled with disgust.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t take me long to figure out who had created this tracker application.  First I found their <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello board</a>, the last addition to which was yesterday.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day29/trello.png" alt="" />
From there I found linked the <a href="https://github.com/CoinCircle/icostats">github</a>, and that led me to <a href="https://coincircle.com/">Coin Circle</a>.

Coin Circle is a company(?) that will help you tokenize your assets to decentralize your chain of trusts and connect you with savvy accredited buyers on the digital platforms of tomorrow, today. Or maybe it&rsquo;s just only on their digitally decentralized platform based distributed ledger system.

<p>I&rsquo;m making fun, but I&rsquo;m genuinely against what they are doing. Maybe my futurevision is a little clouded but to what end are we creating this additional layer of abstraction? Who benefits from the tokenization of an asset? Who loses? Who has control? The &ldquo;market&rdquo;?

Probably just people like this rogues gallery. See you tomorrow.</p>
