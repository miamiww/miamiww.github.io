<p>I recently read about something called <a href="https://jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a>, &ldquo;the leading open source automation server&rdquo;. The name and the logo reminded me of the now long gone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ask.com">Ask Jeeves</a>, a search engine that I used when I was first getting online back in the 90s.</p>

<h2 id="jenkins-automation-server-on-52-73-234-8">Jenkins Automation Server on 52.73.234.8</h2>

<p>I just searched for &ldquo;Jenkins&rdquo; and looked around until I found a result without a login. It was in Ashburn, Virginia which almost certainly meant it was running on AWS in the <a href="https://www.datacenters.com/amazon-aws-ashburn">giant Amazon server facility there</a>.
Checking <code>host</code> confirms that it&rsquo;s running on an AWS EC2.</p>

<pre><code>üëªüåµüîÆ $ host 52.73.234.8
8.234.73.52.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer ec2-52-73-234-8.compute-1.amazonaws.com.
</code></pre>

<p>It was running one thing, a webserver on port 8080.

So Jenkins is for&hellip; automating&hellip; stuff. I didn&rsquo;t really have the time to understand it fully. But it looks here like they were attempting to test out several different applications for <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy/">Samsung Galaxy phones</a>.

I couldn&rsquo;t run anything myself but I was able to see a lot of information about these apps.

The one named &ldquo;yuvalisGod&rdquo; was pretty confusing to me, until I realized that &ldquo;yuval&rdquo; was the name of one of the users of this server.

Given all of this I was able to figure out pretty definitively that this server belonged to the Tel Aviv office of a company named <a href="https://www.perfecto.io/">Perfecto Mobile</a>.</p>

<p>They had various API keys exposed and if I were a black hat I&rsquo;d probably be able to do a lot of damage. Shows the importance of having infosec as part of your devops. See you tomorrow.</p>
