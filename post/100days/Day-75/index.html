<h2 id="voip-wimax-gateway-on-11516711593">VoIP WiMAX Gateway on 115.167.115.93</h2>
<p>Today&rsquo;s just a router. Well not &ldquo;just&rdquo; I router I suppose, it&rsquo;s a powerful router.

The configuration page was running on port 8080, but fortunately for them they had a password and it wasn&rsquo;t a default.</p>
<p>The router is a Gigaset SX686, which as far as I can tell is a &ldquo;high performance&rdquo; router for VoIP. It was manufactured by <a href="https://www.sagemcom.com/">Sagemcom</a>, a French telecom.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day75/gigaset.png" alt="">
Sagemcom has a typical business model for a telecom these days, heavily advertising its smart city and iot branches alongside their core comptetency of manufacturing residential networking equipment.

I figured out that this router was probably supplied to the user by the ISP, <a href="http://qubee.com.pk/join-in/">Qubee</a>, since Qubee advertises that they supply Sagemcom equipment.</p>
<p>They also advertise using the term &ldquo;big data&rdquo; in a wave I&rsquo;ve never seen before.

Qubee is the Pakistani brand name for the broadband of a Dutch multinational company named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augere">Augere</a>. They also serve broadband in Bangladesh, and apparently had plans to expand to Uganda and Rwanda in 2011 according to some old press releases but as of today I couldn&rsquo;t find any sign that they succeeded in that expansion.</p>
<p>See you tomorrow.</p>
