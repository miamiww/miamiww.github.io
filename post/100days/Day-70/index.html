<p>Today I truly cast a stone into the sea blindfolded, and decided to see what typing in just any old random IP address into Shodan would bring up.</p>

<h2 id="wampserver-on-197-230-101-90">WampServer on 197.230.101.90</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what force compelled me to type 197.230.101.90, but it was indeed in Shodan and looked like it was running a website (80 and 443 were serving HTTP) and SQL databases (3306, the <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">mySQL</a> database port and 5432, the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> port were both running). And it looked like a Windows machine, because 137 was running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBIOS">NetBIOS</a>. Before checking the webserver though, I checked WhoIS and DNS, and while the IP address doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s tied to a DNS address (i.e. has no url), the IP address is in a block of addresses fixed to &ldquo;Tanger Med engineering&rdquo;.</p>

<pre><code>inetnum:        197.230.101.88 - 197.230.101.95

</code></pre>

<p>That confirmed for me what Shodan had already told me, that this IP was in Morocco, as Tanger Med is the name of a <a href="https://www.tangermed.ma/en/">huge port complex in Tangier</a>, and Orange Maroc is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_S.A.">the Moroccan subsidiary of Orange, the French telecom giant</a>.</p>

<p>According to their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/tme-tanger-med-engineering-/about/">LinkedIn page</a>, Tanger Med Engineering is a subsidiary of the Tanger Med ownership company, and specializes in international consulting on large-scale infrastructure engineering. Now for something interesting. Tanger Med Engineering&rsquo;s website, which their LinkedIn indicates is www.tme.ma, does not work, giving a &ldquo;refused to connect&rdquo; error. It&rsquo;s specifically a CORS error: &ldquo;Refused to display &lsquo;<a href="https://www.tangermed.ma/en/'">https://www.tangermed.ma/en/'</a> in a frame because it set &lsquo;X-Frame-Options&rsquo; to &lsquo;sameorigin&rsquo;.&rdquo; And I think I know why. Let&rsquo;s get back to the original IP.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day70/firstlook.png" alt="" />
The website it&rsquo;s running is a configuration page for a <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">WampServer</a>. WampServer is &ldquo;a Windows web development environment which allows you to create web applications with Apache2, PHP and a MySQL database&rdquo;. It has one of the most demented mascots you could imagine, click the link to see. Most of those little links you see there are just full of PHP, and I&rsquo;m reminded of a Vine video I saw years ago that was just a fake PHP ad that said &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll always have a job with PHP&rdquo;. PHP has been going strong for almost 25 years, but Vine is gone forever. RIP Vine.</p>

<p>My own life is a little too short to spend too much time looking at PHP, so I focused on the two non-PHP links, TME and TMMS down at the bottom. Now I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve guessed it already, TME does indeed stand for Tanger Med Engineering, and yes indeed, this is their missing website.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day70/tme.png" alt="" />
Why is it here? My guess is that they are working on it, and this WampServer is a Tanger Med staging ground for web development. Maybe it broke, and they set the original URL to show instead a frame of the Tanger Med main page, but it isn&rsquo;t working because they didn&rsquo;t configure the CORS on the main page to allow for that kind of redirect. Have they noticed? Are they worried? This seems like a big problem for a &ldquo;international consulting&rdquo; group. I guess 20 years ago it wouldn&rsquo;t have been too weird not to have a web page that worked. Times have changed.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day70/tmms.png" alt="" />
As for the TMMS, it stands for Tanger Med Marine Simulator, which is another subsidiary of Tanger Med. They do training for ship captains and pilots. It&rsquo;s specifically&hellip; a <a href="http://www.tmpa.ma/en/activites-services/tanger-med-marine-simulator/">room made to look like a boat helm</a>?</p>

<p>Well hopefully they get it sorted out soon. See you tomorrow.</p>
