<p>Oh what a tangled web we weave. I&rsquo;m not really sure what&rsquo;s going on with this one or how I got here, I wanted to explore a search I had seen on Shodan called &ldquo;3cx servers bcn&rdquo; but now I&rsquo;m trapped in a digital hall of mirrors. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3CX_Phone_System">3CX</a> is a private telephone exchange that sometimes runs over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP">VoIP</a>, and has servers that typically tend to run on 5001.</p>

<h2 id="Ï…Î·ÎºÎ·Î¿Ï‰Î·-Î¹Î´ÎµÎ·Õ¥Ï„Î³-on-62-23-216-99">Ï…Î·ÎºÎ·Î¿Ï‰Î· Î¹Î´ÎµÎ·Õ¥Ï„Î³ on 62.23.216.99</h2>

<p>So I looked for things running on ports 5001. One of the first ones I saw was named &ldquo;Ï…Î·ÎºÎ·Î¿Ï‰Î· Î¹Î´ÎµÎ·Õ¥Ï„Î³&rdquo; which, naturally, got me pretty interested.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day20/ssl.png" alt="" />
Going to their IP in a browser automatically tried for https but had a certificate error, and I was really struck by the url for which their certificate had been issued, which is to say that nyc-212.odin.biz sounds fake as hell. Thanks to Azalea Banks I know that 212 is an area code for NYC so at least that checked out with the phone theme. Let&rsquo;s come back to odin.biz in a bit.</p>

<p>Proceeding along to the IP prompts a login for Ï…Î·ÎºÎ·Î¿Ï‰Î· Î¹Î´ÎµÎ·Õ¥Ï„Î³. The login page is very pretty, there is a beach and some birds in the foreground and some mountains in the background. Again, we&rsquo;ll come back to this page later.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day20/unknown.png" alt="" />
The login looked so nice I suspected that it must have a URL.</p>

<pre><code>ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµðŸ”® $ host 62.23.216.99
99.216.23.62.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer mail.mx.vu.
</code></pre>

<p>Aha mail.mx.vu! So this is doing email or something related. What&rsquo;s mx.vu? It doesn&rsquo;t resolve to anything in the browser. According to Shodan it&rsquo;s in Garden City, Kansas.</p>

<pre><code>ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµðŸ”® $ host mx.vu
mx.vu has address 209.200.39.39
mx.vu mail is handled by 10 mail.mx.vu.
mx.vu mail is handled by 20 syno.hno3.de.
ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµðŸ”® $ host syno.hno3.de
syno.hno3.de has address 89.246.70.219
ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµðŸ”® $ host hno3.de
hno3.de has address 80.237.132.25
hno3.de mail is handled by 50 mx0.hno3.de.
ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµðŸ”® $ host mx0.hno3.de
mx0.hno3.de has address 89.246.70.219
</code></pre>

<p>syno.hno3.de and hno3.de are both in Germany, unsurprisingly.
First hno3.de. It&rsquo;s running a page that just shows the following.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day20/hno3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll get back to that one. Loose threads feel like they are piling up yet? Feel like there is a lot of Ï…Î·ÎºÎ·Î¿Ï‰Î· Î¹Î´ÎµÎ·Õ¥Ï„Î³ still to be explored? syno.hno3.de is running on 443 with the following webpage:
<img src="/images/100Days/Day20/syno.png" alt="" />
Just giving a 403 error. Usually that comes after a failed login meaning that you didn&rsquo;t have the correct credentials, and I was wondering if this page were looking for a specific IP to interact with it. I went looking for such a thing and found what was checking whether or not to give the error, a long javascript function embedded in the page that was determining whether or not to send the 403. It began like this:</p>

<pre><code>/* Copyright (c) 2018 Synology Inc. All rights reserved. */

(function(){var a=new XMLHttpRequest();a.open(&quot;get&quot;,&quot;/missing&quot;,true); ...
</code></pre>

<p>Synology Inc! Major clue. And that page requires a specific request to be made via the url, which I was /missing. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synology_Inc.">Synology makes network attached storage</a> as well as a router and a couple of other network goodies.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day20/server.png" alt="" />
Now let&rsquo;s get back to the Ï…Î·ÎºÎ·Î¿Ï‰Î· Î¹Î´ÎµÎ·Õ¥Ï„Î³ login. That page had a fair amount of javascript in it for a simple login page, much of it copyright Synology Inc.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day20/copyright.png" alt="" />
There was also some from other companies, but they seemed to be doing web services and web design work, so it had likely been contracted out by Synology.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day20/lots.png" alt="" />
So this login is probably for another Synology device, maybe storing mail.</p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s get back to odin.biz shall we?</p>

<pre><code>ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµðŸ”® $ host nyc-212.odin.biz
nyc-212.odin.biz has address 62.23.216.99
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s the same IP that I had originally found. So mail.mx.vu is nyc-212.odin.biz. odin.biz however is considerably different from mx.vu. mx.vu doesn&rsquo;t appear to be hosting any web page of any kind, while odin.biz is hosting the same kind of thing as hno3.de!!
<img src="/images/100Days/Day20/odinbiz.png" alt="" />
It turns out this is the default page for any server set up with <a href="https://www.hosteurope.de/en/">Host Europe GmbH</a>, which is the host for these pages. So someone set up these servers and parked default servers on the domain names and are using the domains to direct to a bunch of other servers via <a href="https://ns1.com/knowledgebase/comparing-alias-and-cname-records">CNAME</a>, some of which overlap. How deep does this go?</p>

<pre><code>ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµðŸ”® $ host odin.biz
odin.biz has address 80.237.132.105
odin.biz mail is handled by 50 mx0.odin.biz.

<p>Too deep. Ï…Î·ÎºÎ·Î¿Ï‰Î· Î¹Î´ÎµÎ·Õ¥Ï„Î³ remains as such. See you tomorrow.</p>
