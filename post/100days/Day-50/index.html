Definitely a warehouse or factory or some kind of industrial building. If only I could make out that sign in the upper corner. Since I was getting this stream via RTSP on my VLC player I didn&rsquo;t have any of the usual web server clues to go on, and none of their other ports were accessible (only 554, the typical RTSP port was open).</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t any activity on the camera after a few minutes and well sometimes you get the feeling that life&rsquo;s either too short or too long to be staring at snowy Russian loading bays.
See you tomorrow.</p>
