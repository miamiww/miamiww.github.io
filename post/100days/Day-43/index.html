<p>I decided to double dip on AV receivers since someone was going so deep on them the past few days. Today I decided to look at <a href="https://www.pioneerelectronics.com/PUSA/">Pioneer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pioneer-av-receiver-on-167-142-82-87">Pioneer AV Receiver on 167.142.82.87</h2>

<p>I mostly know pioneer as a manufacturer of <a href="https://www.pioneerdj.com/en-us/product/player/cdj-2000nxs2/black/overview/">CDJs</a>, and had no idea that they had a diverse product line beyond DJ equipment. They make bike equipment and accessories, a wide variety of audio equipment, and some kinds of computer electronics. I found a Pioneer AV receiver in Ohio, in a small town just north of Cincinnati, Shodan indicated it was just running a webserver on port 80.

Nothing too interesting, although they named the device <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eintracht_Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a>, I assume after the German soccer team. There is a link to the owner&rsquo;s Pandora account but it&rsquo;s through a login. However there is the option to upload the firmware, a pretty damming security hole. I also found that this is a VSX-1023 model.

Looks like it&rsquo;s still made! You can buy one for just $400</p>

<p>I decided to check on <code>nmap</code></p>

<pre><code>üëªüåµüîÆ $ nmap 167.142.82.87
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-02-15 22:13 EST

</code></pre>

<p>The https page isn&rsquo;t actually showing anything and 1024 is Apple Play again. 1900 is probably for integration with miscellaneous types of media services.</p>

<p>Shockingly though, and truly inexplicable for me, the 8080 port is running the exact same webservice as the Yamaha device from yesterday.

PRESENTATION PAGE. Again! These are from different manufacturers! I can&rsquo;t find anything about this except for <a href="https://www.avsforum.com/forum/90-receivers-amps-processors/1456710-official-pioneer-sc-1222-k-owners-thread-4.html">similarly confused people on forums</a>. I read the manual, looked in source code search engines, I&rsquo;ve done everything I could think of. I feel like I&rsquo;m trapped in a Bu√±uel film.</p>

<p>Maybe everything I find after this will have a PRESENTATION PAGE. Maybe I&rsquo;ll wake up tomorrow and the New York Times headline will be PRESENTATION PAGE and I&rsquo;ll end up getting PRESENTATION PAGE on my tombstone. See you tomorrow.</p>
