<p>Saw an amazing search on Shodan today: someone searched for &ldquo;kiosk&rdquo; with the comment &ldquo;lotta cool stuff&rdquo;. Lotta cool stuff! How could I resist.</p>

<h2 id="a-library-kiosk-management-system-on-104-239-140-99">A Library Kiosk Management System on 104.239.140.99</h2>

<p>Most of the kiosks seemed to be library kiosks, I even found one from my alma mater&rsquo;s library! I ended up going with the first one that I couldn&rsquo;t immediately figure out the purpose of. It was running some kind of web server on port 3000.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day35/firstlook.png" alt="" />
It seemed to be a scheduling application. It was running the same service on 3001 with different patron names.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day35/secondlook.png" alt="" />
Rather than rack my brain for possibilities though I just Googled the service - <a href="https://libki.org/">Libki Kiosk Management System</a>.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day35/libki.png" alt="" />
So Libki is a system for booking time on computers - more or less, meant for libraries and computer labs.</p>

<p>Now I knew that the system I was looking at was running on a cloud server, but I wanted to know where the actual computers that were being booked were. So I checked it with <code>host</code> to see if anything showed up.</p>

<pre><code>ðŸ‘»ðŸŒµðŸ”® $ host 104.239.140.99
99.140.239.104.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer duchesne-libki.bywatersolutions.com.
</code></pre>

<p>Looks like the IP address is for the domain name duchesne-libki.bywatersolutions.com.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day35/bywatersolutions.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looking at <a href="https://bywatersolutions.com/">ByWater Solutions&rsquo;s website</a> I found that they were actually the makers of Libki, among other software solutions aimed at the library market. The owners seemed really sweet. Maybe I&rsquo;m just feeling hormonal but when I checked their website&rsquo;s WhoIS record and saw that it had one of the owner&rsquo;s real name and personal email address on it I got kind of choked up. So innocent!
<img src="/images/100Days/Day35/theguys.png" alt="" />
By why were they running their own session managing at their company? For testing? Or because they all share computers?</p>

<p>Looking a little harder at the url though, I had an insight: <em>duchesne</em>-libki. Duchesne, as we all know, is the name of a county in Utah. Counties typically have libraries in them. And in fact there is a Duchesne County Library in Duchesne county. And <em>in fact</em> the Duchesne County Library uses Libki.
<img src="http://www.duchesne.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Duchesne-Branch-crop.jpg" alt="" />
How do I know that they use Libki? I checked the <a href="https://www.duchesne.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2015-09-Duchesne-County-Library-Board-Meeting-Minutes.pdf">Duchesne County Library Board Meeting Minutes of September 17, 2015</a>, which clearly states the following:</p>

<p><em>Libki â€“ Patron computer management system is now functioning at both libraries to allow reservations for time
slots on the computers</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/100Days/Day35/meetingminutes.png" alt="" />
Two libraries! That explains the two systems, on 3000 and 3001.</p>

<p>Thank you, public records, and thank you libraries, for championing public space in an age of its retraction from daily life. See you tomorrow.</p>
