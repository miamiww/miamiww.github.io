<p>About a week ago I saw a search for &ldquo;dgraph&rdquo; and I thought today I would take a look. <a href="https://dgraph.io/">Dgraph</a> is a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database">graph database</a>, which is a kind of NoSQL database with a graph-like structure of nodes and edges. The search was for &ldquo;Dgraph Ratel Dashboard&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="dgraph-server-on-13-210-169-101">Dgraph Server on 13.210.169.101</h2>

<p>There were only 5 results, all either in China or Australia, and so I picked one in Australia because Dgraph is based in Sydney. It was running the Dgraph dashboard on port 8081.

There wasn&rsquo;t actually a lot I could do here. It didn&rsquo;t ask me for authentication or anything, there just wasn&rsquo;t any data. All of the results I found seemed this way actually.</p>

<p>According to an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/19/dgraph-raises-3m-for-its-open-source-distributed-graph-database-hits-1-0-release/">article I read, Dgraph seems to be reasonably popular</a>, so I assume that I only found these few results because anyone who actually has data has better secured their system so that they don&rsquo;t show up on Shodan.</p>

<p>Good thinking on their part. See you tomorrow.</p>
