<p>I was feeling listless today and a bit grumpy, so I decided to look for something that I could be motivationally upset about: <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/automated-license-plate-readers-alpr">automatic license plate readers (ALPRs)</a>. These are a kind of surveillance camera that are frequently used by police forces or parking facility managers to track cars and car movement. You might have seen a kind of them attached to traffic signal beams to catch red light runners, but they are used far more widely than just that. There&rsquo;s one in just about every police car and on many street corners, you could even <a href="https://www.a1securitycameras.com/license-plate-recognition-cameras/">buy your own to put wherever you wanted</a>. Checking on one of Shodan&rsquo;s explore guides I saw that one major vendor of ALPRs was named <a href="http://www.pipstechnology.com/">PIPS</a>, so I searched for PIPS ALPR.</p>

<h2 id="an-automatic-license-plate-reader-on-166-150-87-204">An Automatic License Plate Reader on 166.150.87.204</h2>

<p>I only found one result. What I had read on Shodan seemed to indicate that there used to be a whole lot of them visible, so maybe they got better at their security and made them less discoverable. The one that I did find seemed to be using an outdated system, since the PIPS logo appeared to be an old version (which looks suspiciously like <a href="https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/screen-shot-2016-07-18-at-10-05-33-am.png?w=1240&amp;strip=all&amp;quality=75">Amazon&rsquo;s old logo</a>) and the copyright was for 2006. I was able to access it via browser on port 8083.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day10/Pips.png" alt="" />
I first tried to see if I could &ldquo;see through the camera&rdquo;. There was an option for that but unfortunately it was running in a java applet and modern browsers don&rsquo;t allow java plugins. This thing really was old!
<img src="/images/100Days/Day10/java.png" alt="" />
Finding a version of a browser that would let me install java wasn&rsquo;t really worth it to me, so I kept looking around. I found some details on the system pretty quickly. Interesting that it seemed to be in Louisiana (I believe what it&rsquo;s talking about in that line below is that it&rsquo;s using a Louisiana license plate database), as Shodan couldn&rsquo;t tell me where the IP was located beyond the United States.

Checking on a slideshare deck about the PIPS 372 from 2009 I was able to find a little bit more about this specific camera model. It appears that PIPS no long manufactures the 372 (the oldest model they still advertise is the <a href="http://www.pipstechnology.com/fixedalpr/">much sleeker 392+</a>), but you can buy a used <a href="https://www.govdeals.com/index.cfm?fa=Main.Item&amp;itemID=2898&amp;acctID=8445">government surplus one on the cheap</a>.
<img src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/fwindowsvistapresentamarcopipspipspresentation-maprimaq-espanol-090626180417-phpapp01/95/pips-control-de-vehiculos-9-728.jpg?cb=1246041898" alt="" />
I tried to downloaded all of the recorded pictures but got a 700 error, but also I noticed that I would intermittently be unable to connect anymore, and generally navigating around the system was extremely slow. Another weird thing - each time I checked it with <code>nmap</code> it would show me something slightly different.</p>

<pre><code>➜  sandbox git:(master) ✗ nmap 166.150.87.204 -Pn

<p>And then just a few minutes later:</p>

<pre><code>➜  sandbox git:(master) ✗ nmap 166.150.87.204 -Pn

</code></pre>

<p>This kind of thing is the reason I grind my teeth at night so much. Just why?? I think part of the reason has to do with the reverse DNS: yadayada.myvzw.com. After looking at it, myvzw.com seems to reference the Verizon Wireless mobile customer network. And so I could occasionally be losing connection because this camera system is on a bad mobile hotspot. Why are the ports showing inconsistently (and occasionally telling me that the host is up but that all ports are filtered, which I know isn&rsquo;t true because I&rsquo;m looking at it on 8083)?</p>

<p>I was able to download the camera&rsquo;s event log, and all I was able to discern from it was that it had been rebooted about a half dozen times in the past couple of days. Maybe it&rsquo;s just kind of janky? It is pretty old in the world of computational devices. Another possibility is that the BlackICE service, which is a (<a href="https://www.itprotoday.com/compute-engines/blackice">now very outdated and no longer used</a>) service designed to prevent intrusion attempts, running on 8081 is recognizing me as an intruder. I did <code>nmap</code> it a half dozen times after all. See you tomorrow.</p>
