<p>Today I saw a search for &ldquo;charging station&rdquo; and I thought I would take a look.</p>

<h2 id="electric-car-charging-station-on-62-103-74-118">Electric Car Charging Station on 62.103.74.118</h2>

<p>There seemed to be a variety of brands of devices that showed up, but all of them were charging stations for electric cars. I ended up picking one in Greece with no authentication. It was running a webserver on port 10000.

I love this. It&rsquo;s a dashboard for an electric vehicle charging station made by <a href="http://etrel.com/">Etrel</a>, a Slovenian maker of such charging stations (here&rsquo;s the <a href="https://www.zielony-dom.pl/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Etrel-INCH-User-manual-EN.pdf">manual</a>).

They look slick. Very modern. Unfortunately not very secure, as the default is to have no password on the web interface.

I could add my own password, or change the maximum current of the charger. Most interestingly for me I could see the usage history in kWh.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day74/recentuse.png" alt="" />
That&rsquo;s pretty low. Like barely anything low. According to a <a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1082737_electric-car-efficiency-forget-mpge-it-should-be-miles-kwh">guide I read</a> the average electric car uses about 3.4 kWh per mile. So that means that the roughly .15 kWh/day this charger has been using in the past week is likely just the &ldquo;vampire draw&rdquo; of having the vehicle plugged in without any real use.

Looking at the annual usage it seemed like the vehicle probably hadn&rsquo;t been used since April 2018. Before that it was showing usage (with quite a few spikes and then seeming non-use) since 2016.</p>

<p>Since it is on Crete, an island in the Mediterranean, there aren&rsquo;t particularly large distances to travel, so I understand the light and inconsistent usage. Seems a little strange though. See you tomorrow.</p>
