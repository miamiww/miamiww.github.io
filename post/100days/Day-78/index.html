<p>Today I&rsquo;ve been trying to write a paper about the waste industry and garbage, so I decided to search on Shodan just for the word &ldquo;garbage&rdquo; and see what I get.</p>

<h2 id="telnet-service-on-62-133-200-27">Telnet Service on 62.133.200.27</h2>

<p>There were about 100 results, most of them garbage themselves. But I found one in the Netherlands that perplexed me. It showed up in my Shodan search because Shodan had gotten the following response on port 7777:</p>

<pre><code>remote: 46.178.111.82 48586
local: 62.133.200.27 7777
0
 1:43PM  up 2023 days,  3:20, 0 users, load averages: 1.14, 1.13, 1.16

What I've done, of course, is total garbage.

<p>I had a hunch at what I was seeing here, but I wanted to test it out first myself.</p>

<pre><code>👻🌵🔮 $ nc 62.133.200.27 7777
remote: [REDACTED ;)] 55065
local: 62.133.200.27 7777
0
 3:44AM  up 2028 days, 17:21, 0 users, load averages: 0.30, 0.37, 0.41

It would be nice if the Food and Drug Administration stopped issuing
warnings about toxic substances and just gave me the names of one or
two things still safe to eat.

<p>This looks like the output from the old unix command, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)">fortune</a>. Back when I was learning bash one of the first things I learned how to do was pipe <code>fortune</code> to <code>cowsay</code>. <code>fortune</code> outputs various quotes and sayings that are full of the kind of asinine nerd humor that kept gen x unix programmers smirking while their code compiled. I kept netcatting the port and kept getting different sayings and quotes, all of which seemed like they were from <code>fortune</code>. I found that it was also running on port 23.</p>

<pre><code>👻🌵🔮 $ nc 62.133.200.27 23
remote: [REDACTED ;)] 64347
local: 62.133.200.27 23
0
 4:21AM  up 2028 days, 13:59, 0 users, load averages: 0.46, 0.46, 0.40

Fudd's First Law of Opposition:
        Push something hard enough and it will fall over.

<p>It&rsquo;s definitely fortune. If that&rsquo;s not enough to convince you, I ran it so many times that I eventually got an error</p>

<pre><code>👻🌵🔮 $ nc 62.133.200.27 23
remote: [REDACTED ;)] 63466
local: 62.133.200.27 23
0
 4:48AM  up 2028 days, 18:25, 0 users, load averages: 0.57, 0.47, 0.39

Usage: fortune -P [] -a [xsz] [Q: [file]] [rKe9] -v6[+] dataspec ... inputdir
</code></pre>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry it still works, I don&rsquo;t know exactly what went wrong that time. You can see from the return that it has been up for 2028 days, which is over five years.</p>

<p>Who has been running two fortune telnet services for five years, and why?</p>

<p>On port 13 it looks like they are also running a date/time service.</p>

<pre><code>👻🌵🔮 $ nc 62.133.200.27 13

</code></pre>

<p>I ended up finding a bunch about this person, but I figured I should leave them alone. If you ever want to find them, you may find the phrase &ldquo;tranquility quidor&rdquo; to be helpful.</p>

<p>See you tomorrow.</p>
