<p>Busy today so I found an IP camera. This time I got one of my all time favorites, an <a href="https://www.axis.com/en-us">AXIS</a> camera, this one with <a href="https://www.axis.com/en-us/products/axis-q6128-e/">a 4K resolution and 700° pan/tilt control</a>.</p>

<h2 id="axis-q6128-e-network-camera-on-107-85-76-185">AXIS Q6128-E Network Camera on 107.85.76.185</h2>

<p>Shodan couldn&rsquo;t identify where it was beyond &ldquo;United States&rdquo;, and I found that was likely because it was connected to the network via a mobile <a href="https://www.sierrawireless.com/products-and-solutions/routers-gateways/airlink/">Sierra AirLink router</a>, the kind we&rsquo;ve seen several times now. So my main goal was just to find out where this camera is.

Good start, it&rsquo;s in a construction site and I have pan/tilt/zoom control to look around with. Because it&rsquo;s 4K I can get extremely zoomed in with very high resolution.

This thermostat is on the third-farthest central beam. I can almost make out the temperature, but not quite. But look at that dirt!

I found this thing that looks like a face with teeth on the far wall. Well it kind of looks like a face.

After looking around for awhile, finally I found  a tag on one of the pieces of equipment, which read</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Northern Illinois<br />
SERVICE<br />
Rockford, Illinois</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aha! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockford,_Illinois">Rockford, Illinois</a>, or at least somewhere close by.</p>

<p>I think we can call this one case closed. See you tomorrow.</p>
