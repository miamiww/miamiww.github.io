</code></pre><p>This warned me off trying to probe it too much, so I&rsquo;m just going off what I see on Shodan. It&rsquo;s also running a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_IOS">Cisco IOS</a> HTTP login on port 80. Cisco IOS is Cisco&rsquo;s router software, so I feel safe in assume that this is a router. It also says &ldquo;Astinet Router&rdquo; in the warning, and after looking into it I&rsquo;ve found that <a href="https://indihomesukabumi.com/astinet/">Astinet</a> is the name of PT Telkon&rsquo;s internet service. They have a nice little ad.

STO Kerek, I think is the name of a <a href="https://trustklik.wordpress.com/sto-kerek/">fiber network in the Tuban area</a>.</p>
<p>So where is the router? We actually have a ton of clues from the warning. It belongs to <a href="https://www.holcim.co.id/en">PT Holcim Indonesia Tbk</a>, the Indonesian branch of a <a href="https://www.lafargeholcim.com/">global cement and building materials company</a>. It did not take me very much Googling to find that <a href="http://www.globalcement.com/news/item/3922-holcim-set-to-operate-new-us-350m-tuban-ii-cement-plant">Holcim runs</a> <a href="https://www.lafargeholcim.com/lafargeholcim-completes-tuban-plant-project-indonesia">a cement factory in Tuban</a>, which they call the <a href="https://www.holcim.co.id/en/lokasi/tuban-plant/3001">Holcim Tuban Plant</a>, hence the name on the router, Tuban Plant.</p>
<p>Here it is on Google maps.

<p>Feels so strange to reach out like this and find yourself at a cement factory in Indonesia. It must be so humid there. Imagine watching the sunset from the top of one of those towers, your shift finishing. Maybe you&rsquo;re making some repairs, and you&rsquo;re ready to get home but you know you&rsquo;ve got an hour bike ride ahead of you.</p>
<p>Where does the cement go? What buildings have been made from it? Holcim&rsquo;s press releases mentioned its proximity to the coast and to shipping lines as a reason they built the factory there. So it could be anywhere. Maybe there&rsquo;s some in new construction here in New York. See you tomorrow.</p>
