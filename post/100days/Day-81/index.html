<p>Today a search for &ldquo;unprotected WiMAX towers&rdquo;. The word tower was pretty tantalizing. The actual search was for &ldquo;OX253P&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="wimax-tower-on-117-244-48-33">WiMAX Tower on 117.244.48.33</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WiMAX">WiMAX</a> is a communication standard meant to give <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile">last mile</a> wireless access to the internet to homes and businesses using microwaves. This would be a wireless alternative to DSL and cable internet, not requiring any cabling to the home endpoint, only a receiver antenna, much like LTE. It works much in the same way as cell towers, and frequently <a href="https://gizmodo.com/giz-explains-how-cell-towers-work-5177322">WiMAX and cell towers are bundled into one</a>. It&rsquo;s not used much in North America, because there was so much existing copper infrastructure, but it&rsquo;s popular in many other countries. All the results in my search were from India, so I picked one at random.</p>

<p>It was running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol">SNMP</a> on port 161 and a webserver on 80.

I believe this is actually someone&rsquo;s home antenna, and not a tower. Judging from the <a href="https://fccid.io/I88OX253P/User-Manual/User-Manual-1403055">user manual</a> the default password is admin/admin. But of course I didn&rsquo;t try it :)</p>

<p>See you tomorrow.</p>
