			<p>I had a red eye flight last night and am deliriously sleepy, and somewhere in this state bubbled up a strong desire to find an electronic highway billboard and read what it said remotely.

<p>Skyline manufactures quite a few different kinds of signs, but all of them are related to car transit.

<p>I found a few dozen results, all of them in the US, and I picked one in Los Angeles, with the thought that as the center of American car culture LA might have some interesting signs.</p>
<p>On port 161 the IP was running a service that used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol">Simple Network Management Protocol</a>. I installed a set of <a href="http://snmplabs.com/snmpclitools/snmpget.html">SNMP Python tools</a> to try and see if I could make a request for the contents of the sign, but given my aforementioned sleep deprivation addled state I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to make it work. I could definitely connect, but then had no idea what kind of flags to use etc and none of the examples I was seeing would work. Maybe it just was refusing me as I wasn&rsquo;t authenticated, who knows. It was also running telnet servers on 23 and 2332, but both of those require logins.

On 9091 and 9443 it was running a login for a <a href="https://www.sierrawireless.com/">Sierra Wireless</a> <a href="https://www.sierrawireless.com/resources/QtrlyNewsletters/Announcements/AceWare_Mar08_Announce/AceWare_Mar08_announce.html">Acemanager AirLink</a> login. If you remember from back on day 32, the Sierra Wireless AirLink is a rugged router for remote outdoor locations.

That makes sense given that it&rsquo;s a road sign of some kind. I was able to find the contentless xml of what&rsquo;s past the login screen. Even if I could log in, it doesn&rsquo;t look like there would be any clues about what the sign actually said.</p>
<p>I went back and futzed with the SNMP a bit more, but realized that it&rsquo;s not reaching out into the world and reading some random digital street sign that I needed. What I needed was a nap. See you tomorrow.</p>
