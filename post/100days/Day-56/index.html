<p>I saw a search today for someone looking for <a href="https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/product/LSS100200/spacelynk-logic-controller/?range=62958-spacelynk&amp;node=2640385230-products">spaceLYnk logic controllers</a>, a kind of logic controller for SCADA systems made by <a href="https://www.schneider-electric.com/ww/en/">Schneider Electric</a> (SCADA, if you remember from day 30, stands for supervisory control and data acquisition).</p>

<h2 id="spacelynk-scada-system-on-213-6-102-238">spaceLYnk SCADA System on 213.6.102.238</h2>

<p>There were quite a few results from all over the place, but I noticed that most of them didn&rsquo;t have visualizations of the system. So I picked one that had the whole system mapped out, in Palestine.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day56/firstlook.png" alt="" />
It&rsquo;s the control system for a building housing a store called Bethlehem Nativity Souvenirs, and, unsurprisingly at this point, I seem to have complete control over the system. I can turn lights on and off, open and close the gate, turn central fan systems on and off.

<p>I&rsquo;m not doing any of that of course.

<p>These aren&rsquo;t live camera feeds by the way, they are just image stills. Images taken with a Nikon D7200 Camera on May 8th 2018 between 3PM and 4PM, using a AF-S DX VR Zoom-Nikkor 18-200mm lens. The serial number of the lens is 9418427. Yes I checked the <a href="https://photographylife.com/what-is-exif-data">EXIF data</a>, but I was desperate. For you see, even though I know the name of this store, even though I can turn its lights on and off and cause all other kinds of mayhem, I can&rsquo;t figure out exactly where it is.
<a href="http://www.bethlehemnativitygroup.com/"><img src="/images/100Days/Day56/bethlehemnativity.png" alt="" /></a>
They have a <a href="http://www.bethlehemnativitygroup.com/">website</a>.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day56/facebook.png" alt="" />
And they have a Facebook page.</p>

<p>And on that Facebook page they have an address, but on Google maps, at that address, there is, well, see for yourself.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day56/oldshop.png" alt="" />
Yes it is a Bethlehem Nativity Souvenirs store! But it is not the one in the SCADA visualizer, which is clearly a much more recent construction. Nowhere in any of their online presence do they indicate having another shop. The Google street view images are from 2017, so I thought that perhaps they remodeled, but I checked on Trip Advisor reviews of the hotel next door, looked through all of the recent images of the hotel to see if I could spot the store, and yes, as of late 2018 it appears that the store looks the same as it does here.</p>

<p>I also want to point out that this amazing, unique and original cafe is across the street.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day56/stars.png" alt="" />
I fruitlessly searched Google maps for a bit, looking either for it a place that could inhabit this newly renovated building. The closest I got was this building.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day56/oldversion.png" alt="" />
If you look at it just right, then&hellip; maybe? No, it&rsquo;s pointless. I should just call them.</p>

<p>But speaking to another human? That might be a step too far. Plus, how to explain? See you tomorrow.</p>
