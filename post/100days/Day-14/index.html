<p>This is another find inspired by recent searches on Shodan. I saw searches &ldquo;FHEM Home Automation&rdquo; and I needed to know more.</p>

<h2 id="fhem-home-automation-server-on-85-190-248-171">Fhem Home Automation Server on 85.190.248.171</h2>

<p>Every single result for FHEM was from Germany. So I picked the first one and got going. Looking up <a href="https://www.fhem.de/">FHEM</a> first on Google I found that it is an open source server software for doing home automation, built in perl and meant to be run on any kind of full time <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> computer, like a Raspberry Pi. It was made in Germany but has full English documentation.

Since I read that the servers were telnet enabled I first tried connecting to this IP via telnet on port 23. It was closed, so then I did a port scan via <code>nmap</code>, and wound up getting some errors that I still don&rsquo;t fully understand.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t get anywhere with 9 or 5060 but 8083 is hosting a web page and I could see it in the browser.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day14/thehome.png" alt="" />
Uh oh! No password on the telnet port? But what&rsquo;s the telnet port, since the usual one wasn&rsquo;t open? I went checking in the event logs to see if there were any clues.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day14/telnetport.png" alt="" />
Aha! So it&rsquo;s 7072. However when I tried to log in I got an immediate rejection, like the port had been configured to only accept connections from a specific IP. Maybe whatever machine this server is running on has a firewall that the server software isn&rsquo;t acknowledging. There is quite a bit of information in the web page though, and I quickly got a bit uncomfortable with how much access I seemed to have.
<img src="/images/100Days/Day14/temperature.png" alt="" />
<img src="/images/100Days/Day14/current.png" alt="" />
I seemed to be able to access house data like temperature, power load, fan speeds, and more. And not just for the current day, but for every day, going back to April 19 2016 (though the graphic visualizations are only for the current day).
<img src="/images/100Days/Day14/history.png" alt="" />
It seems like this home has a PV panel also and was documenting how much power it generated. And I seemed to be able to uh turn it off? And not only that but I could seemingly do things like&hellip; turn off the lights in the house?
<img src="/images/100Days/Day14/lights.png" alt="" />
In taking that screenshot I accidentally clicked one of the lightbulbs on. I was suddenly struck with the idea that I&rsquo;d possibly just woken this person up, since it was the middle of the night in Germany. Needless to say, I decided to stop there. See you tomorrow.</p>

<p>PS here&rsquo;s my traveling <code>traceroute</code>, from Cuties Coffee in Los Angeles to Vreden, Germany.</p>
