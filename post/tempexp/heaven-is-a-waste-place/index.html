<p><em>&ldquo;In the end everything&rsquo;s garbage&rdquo;</em> - Nick DiMola (one of my experts)</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Trash carries dystopia within&rdquo;</em> - Maite Zubiaurre</p>

<p><img src="/images/TempExp/trash/Logo2_text.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In trying to step back and synthesize my research I had to step one layer farther and re-ask myself: what have my research questions been and how have I made the connections that I&rsquo;ve made?</p>

<h3 id="research-questions-as-they-have-arisen-selected-list">Research questions as they have arisen (selected list)</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>What is the history of the disposable object?</p></li>

<li><p>How does the disposable object disappear from the point of view of the discarder and what is its end of life cycle?</p></li>

<li><p>How are these systems of throwing out integrated with other areas of modern life?</p></li>

<li><p>What&rsquo;s the garbage supply chain and how is it different from the product supply chain?</p></li>

<li><p>What is the role of discard within production supply chains (what does waste look like in production)?</p></li>

<li><p>How does trash travel?</p></li>

<li><p>What is the connection between throwing out and spiritual cleanliness/holiness (is throwing away a modern holy act)?</p></li>

<li><p>What is the affective experience of the discarder?</p></li>

<li><p>What are the affordances and formal elements of the garbage medium?</p></li>

<li><p>What is the role of the corporation as sellers of abstraction (garbage <em>removal</em> as service)?</p></li>

<li><p>Who are the communities most engaged with garbage and the discard of others?</p></li>

<li><p>What is a Xenofeminist approach to garbage? (if XF is a politics of alienation then must it be an identification with garbage, i.e. the alienated object)</p></li>

<li><p>Is garbage definable as the alienated object?</p></li>

<li><p>What is an Accelerationist approach to garbage?</p></li>

<li><p>Why is it that e-waste, a type of object not fitting into the past removal strategy paradigm, still forced into the same channels? (i.e. why is there not a new innovative strategy much in the way that recycling was an innovation for an increase in plastics)</p></li>

<li><p>What are the affordances of the e-waste medium?</p></li>

<li><p>What is apocalyptic about garbage, i.e. is the future of garbage necessarily ecological disaster?</p></li>

<li><p>How can we create utopia within the ongoing now given the sloughing off of mountains of trash that every action seems to create?</p></li>

<li><p>How are Seasteaders free to imagine and create their odious utopia when the rest of us have to muck about with the real?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Frequently these questions arose in the process of investigation for other questions, though I did not well document the question-arising-process, though I attempted to recreate the temporal flow of my notebooks here.</p>

<h3 id="research-conclusions">Research conclusions</h3>

<p>In the process of attempting answers to these questions I reached the following conclusions and strategies.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>E-waste, while itself is a wicked problem, is an area of low-hanging-fruit. Most people are not aware of the problems of e-waste and its disposal, and thus creating a way to educate people in this area is a good lever into helping them into a wider understanding of our garbage culture.</p></li>

<li><p>Garbage as a medium can be hugely good fun. Recontextualizing your own trash as a playful object feels joyful and freeing, and this defamiliarization of the garbage object opens up a space for intervention.</p></li>

<li><p>The the global garbage system itself is overwhelmingly complex. It makes me sick and depressed. I start crying when I think about the number of shipping containers full of waste plastics over the ocean at any time.</p></li>

<li><p>The layers of abstraction and complexities of the global systems in garbage make a systemic subversive intervention difficult. I believe that exaggeration of the features of the system might be a possible lever, and overidentification with the corporations moving in the garbage space seemed like an in to that exageration. An overidentificatied corporation is a cult.</p></li>
</ul>
