      On first glance of a boarding pass I notice not just a jumble of information poorly organized, but too much information, a heaping mass of which obscures the information that the traveller is really am interested in when they have a pass in hand.
The date is unnecessary, a traveler would only be receiving this pass on the day of the flight. Origin and destinations are also unnecessary; we must assume that they have knowledge of their destination and current locations already in mind.

      Since moving to New York I&#8217;ve done it again and again: swiped my MetroCard through the reader only to slam at full walking speed into an unmoving turnstile. At first I thought the problem was just me, I was new to the subway and hadn&#8217;t gotten the hang of swiping smoothly enough to avoid &#8220;PLEASE SWIPE AGAIN&#8221;, but then I noticed that I was not alone in my turnstile mistakes. Not only were other people getting the &#8220;PLEASE SWIPE AGAIN&#8221; message, they were walking straight into the turnstile after doing it.

      I&#8217;ve been wanting to recreate the experience of playing with confetti, this is one prototype for interacting with confetti by &#8220;blowing&#8221; on it with the mouse.

Right now they kind of jiggle around expectantly, this was to meet the &#8220;one element that moves independently of the mouse&#8221; part of the homework.Â Getting the confetti to move realistically when blown has been a pain, right now it jumps around semi-randomly, which gives a good imitation of a scattering effect but the motion is discontinuous and unnatural.

      Pen Switch
My first switch was very simple,Â I wanted to incorporate elements outside of the traditional breadboard circuit soÂ I used the metal part of a pen to connect two circuit elements and complete a circuit and light up an LED.Â 
Servo Switch
I really wanted to get my hands into programming the arduino so I next made a switch that involves stringing a resistor into the arm of a small servo motor and using the arduino to control the movements of the motor so that it completes a circuit and lights up an LED.

      I started out my sign research scouting by going to the Rob Rauschenberg show at MoMA. Rauschenberg makes copious use of street signage, here are a couple of examples:
Decontextualizing signs makes them jarring, bringing them much more to the forefront of our consciousness than they occupy in their usual streetside homes.

        Janet Cardiff Sound Walk and Reading Response
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      For several hours after I finishedÂ Her Long Black Hair, Janet Cardiff&#8217;s Central Park sound walk combining field recording, found object and narrative techniques of film noir, I felt a heightened awareness of the world around me, a sense that both the aural and visual information I was consuming had hidden narratives, meanings unknown to me, entire words and lives just beyond the field of my comprehension. This sense of hidden but pulsating alive connectivity is the central goal of Cardiff&#8217;s work: to create connections within time between the walker/listener and the spaces and strangers around them, and to create connections across time, between the walker/listener, the woman with black hair, Orpheus descending into Hades to rescue Eurydice, and Cardiff herself, connecting and condensing these moments of time and myth into a gem of experiential authenticity.

        Akira Poster Design Analysis

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Visually striking and iconic* &#8211; the original poster for the film Akira brings forth a sense of encroaching gloom, of decay, of violence, all with a startling minimalism. The film depicts the country of Japan at a time of crisis, evoked here in the poster by centering the colors of the Japanese flag and surrounding them with creeping, looming shadows of blue-grey.
The eye is immediately drawn by the image organization and the blue splash on his jacket toward the figure in the center, bringing him front and center to the poster and indicating that he is, if not the lead character, at least central to the film.

      Within ten minutes of using any screened device my left eye begins to strain and ache. My wrists hurt almost constantly and frequently I need to use wrist splints when typing in order to avoid the pain. When I go to sleep at night I have a dull ache in my neck and between my eyes, and when I wake up my first thought is to check my phone. Before thinking about coffee, before thinking about food, or work, or my day ahead, or my partner lying beside me, a light goes off in my brain, a synapse fires, indicating that it is seeking a dopamine reward for checking Twitter.
