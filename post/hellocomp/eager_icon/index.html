<p>In order to add the speech audio I had to do a lot of refactoring of what I had already done because the text wasn&rsquo;t easily put into a function.</p>

<p>You can see the code
<a href="https://github.com/miamiww/HelloComputer/tree/master/talk_to_me">here</a>.</p>

<p>I took the javascript from the examples in class and more or less used it as is. I don&rsquo;t know if I like it with the voice because it&rsquo;s hard to put the kinds of emotions I am imagining the voice to have into the speech using just this API, I actually think I prefer just-text to the way it is now, but it is good to try different things.</p>
