Unfortunately going south here should get you into the forest. I encountered numerous other bugs, such as items not appearing in the rooms they should be in, and getting stuck in a room permanently. Also I noticed that whenever I quit the game and restarted it, it would start in the room I had left in. Curious&hellip;</p>
<p>You can see all of the code <a href="https://github.com/miamiww/HelloComputer/tree/master/talk_adventure">here</a>. I think the last issue is because I used global variables to set up the &ldquo;current room&rdquo;, which I have reset when I &lsquo;quit&rsquo; properly, but that won&rsquo;t reset if I just exit out of the test window. I think really I should be using a &ldquo;world-object&rdquo; or something of the like, that keeps track of all the &lsquo;rooms&rsquo;, their states, geographic relationship to each other, and what they have in them. But that doesn&rsquo;t answer to me why you can get stuck in a room, and debugging on DialogFlow is a bit of a pain.</p>
