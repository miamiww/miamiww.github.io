    In the first class I mentioned peñabots as an example of government social media manipulation. Rather than define them myself I&#8217;ll lean on the Wikipedia page definition: &#8220;the name given to what analysts believe to be a network of automated accounts on social media used by the Mexican government to spread pro-government propaganda and to marginalize dissenting opinions in social media&#8221;. Though not the first institutionally-organized trolling operation they stand apart for their sophistication, their effectiveness at shutting down oppositional organizing, and their use in a nominally non-authoritarian government (although one with a deep history of media manipulation).  <a href="/2018/02/15/312/">Read More...</a>

a) short enough so that I could transcribe the whole thing

    One of my favorite word games to play is to try to suss out the grey areas of meaning with seemingly well established words (e.g. what foot angle and distance of leaving the floor differentiates a &#8216;tap&#8217; from a &#8216;step&#8217;, in what ways are the aesthetic associations of a crypt different from those of a mausoleum).

I overhauled some of the code from my project last week so that events would only happen once so that the player would not experience an event more than once. I&#8217;d like to implement some further tracking so that the narrative would change depending on what the user had done previously but I didn&#8217;t finish that in a playable way.

    I wanted to make a project that would display a dubiously motivational message each time I sat at my home office desk. To start off I used a HC-SR04 ping distance sensor and attached a pin with a message (in this case a pin I got at the art book fair) to a little SG90 micro servo motor. I initially tried to map the distance readings of the HC-SR04 to the angle of the servo motor, but it was too noisy and the servo jittered around quickly (you can see that code commented out below).  <a href="/2017/10/04/breaking-a-servo/">Read More...</a>

As you can see from the above picture Amitabh, Martin, and I had a few different ideas, but we settled on a device that takes the way in which online human communications are mediated via AI algorithms and replicates it in the real world.

    I&#8217;ve been wanting to recreate the experience of playing with confetti, this is one prototype for interacting with confetti by &#8220;blowing&#8221; on it with the mouse.

Right now they kind of jiggle around expectantly, this was to meet the &#8220;one element that moves independently of the mouse&#8221; part of the homework. Getting the confetti to move realistically when blown has been a pain, right now it jumps around semi-randomly, which gives a good imitation of a scattering effect but the motion is discontinuous and unnatural.  <a href="/2017/09/25/blowing-on-confetti/">Read More...</a>

    I started out my sign research scouting by going to the Rob Rauschenberg show at MoMA. Rauschenberg makes copious use of street signage, here are a couple of examples:
Decontextualizing signs makes them jarring, bringing them much more to the forefront of our consciousness than they occupy in their usual streetside homes.
(*\* if you are reading this it means that my webhost is terrible and will not let me upload a picture of Hans Deli&#8217;s sign I took &#8211; what I have to say about it is that it is simple, effective, and purposeful **)  <a href="/2017/09/19/sign-intervention/">Read More...</a>

    I started off by trying to make faces/icons in the style of the Netflix user icons.

Quickly I got bored with that so then I started trying to make patterns with simple shapes that could be optical illusions or tiled as a desktop background&#8230; or a website background 🙂 I used for loops to avoid copy/pasting all my code:

    For several hours after I finished Her Long Black Hair, Janet Cardiff&#8217;s Central Park sound walk combining field recording, found object and narrative techniques of film noir, I felt a heightened awareness of the world around me, a sense that both the aural and visual information I was consuming had hidden narratives, meanings unknown to me, entire words and lives just beyond the field of my comprehension. This sense of hidden but pulsating alive connectivity is the central goal of Cardiff&#8217;s work: to create connections within time between the walker/listener and the spaces and strangers around them, and to create connections across time, between the walker/listener, the woman with black hair, Orpheus descending into Hades to rescue Eurydice, and Cardiff herself, connecting and condensing these moments of time and myth into a gem of experiential authenticity.  <a href="/2017/09/14/janet-cardiff-sound-walk/">Read More...</a>

    Visually striking and iconic* &#8211; the original poster for the film Akira brings forth a sense of encroaching gloom, of decay, of violence, all with a startling minimalism. The film depicts the country of Japan at a time of crisis, evoked here in the poster by centering the colors of the Japanese flag and surrounding them with creeping, looming shadows of blue-grey.
The eye is immediately drawn by the image organization and the blue splash on his jacket toward the figure in the center, bringing him front and center to the poster and indicating that he is, if not the lead character, at least central to the film.  <a href="/2017/09/13/48/">Read More...</a>

    Within ten minutes of using any screened device my left eye begins to strain and ache. My wrists hurt almost constantly and frequently I need to use wrist splints when typing in order to avoid the pain. When I go to sleep at night I have a dull ache in my neck and between my eyes, and when I wake up my first thought is to check my phone. Before thinking about coffee, before thinking about food, or work, or my day ahead, or my partner lying beside me, a light goes off in my brain, a synapse fires, indicating that it is seeking a dopamine reward for checking Twitter.  <a href="/2017/09/11/what-is-interaction/">Read More...</a>
