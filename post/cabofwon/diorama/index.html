I really do love flossing and look forward to it every evening.

Construction wasn&rsquo;t too hard but took some ingenuity. I used a shoebox, construction paper, tissue paper, and a clear plastic egg carton for the teeth. Quite a bit of tape, and of course a piece of floss.</p>

<p>I really do love flossing and look forward to it every evening. When I was much younger I would never floss but I&rsquo;ve had a lot of problems with my teeth and jaw over the years and have since become a total convert, maybe it gives me the feeling of being in control a bit more over a part of me that has been so unruly. I even take a particular joy in not flossing when I just feel too tired, like it&rsquo;s a tiny luxury to skip flossing when I&rsquo;ve been working until 4AM, a little something I can allow myself.

As you can see my diorama fits in nicely with all the others.</p>
