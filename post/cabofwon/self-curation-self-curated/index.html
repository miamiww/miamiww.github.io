			<p>A show based on my own biography? It&rsquo;s almost too much to ask, my brain feels like it&rsquo;s turning over trying to keep up with the flood of associations. There&rsquo;s me as a young dancer, watching William Forsythe&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2CyEF9ot6g">Improvisation Technologies</a>, or working with <a href="https://www.physicaleducation.life/">Physical Education</a>, or reading <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/07/collected-stories-lydia-davis-review">The Collected Stories of Lydia Davis</a>. Going to <a href="http://www.berghain.de/">Berghain</a> with my sister and then reading <a href="http://lauragonzalez.com/TC/BUTLER_gender_trouble.pdf">Gender Trouble</a> all the next day without sleeping. There&rsquo;s me as a young gallerist flying to New York to see the <a href="https://www.newmuseum.org/calendar/view/556/release-party-wynne-greenwood-and-friends">Wynn Greenwood</a> show that such and such person had curated with the New Museum. <a href="https://www.eai.org/artists/13154/titles">Ellen Cantor</a> and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/cancer-became-my-whole-brain-kathy-acker-final-year">Kathy Acker</a>. Dragging myself to <a href="http://s1portland.com/">S1</a> with a broken ankle to participate in <a href="https://www.publicationstudio.biz/books/lessons-in-heterosexuality/">Lessons in Heterosexuality</a>.

<code>Here I am biking back from the Chichu Art Museum</code></p>
<p>I have to stop there or my mind will be trapped in nostalgia the rest of the evening. I don&rsquo;t know how I would incorporate any of this into an exhibition. It might need to be more of a festival, since so many of these are performance works and performance artists. Several of them are dead, which would also be an issue. It might just have to be stories, my own oral history. I can&rsquo;t imagine many people would be interested in that however.</p>
