<p>Scattershot (I&rsquo;m very sleepy today), responses to the readings:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a long-running idea that I have yet been able to turn into a project that connects modern narratives of robot uprising to male fears of female empowerment.</li>
<li>The presumed male only gaze of video game audiences is noxious, how to dismantle the myth of the male gamer?</li>
<li>I used to be a queer separatist and have mostly moved away from that political position but&hellip; well I don&rsquo;t feel like all video games need to be &lsquo;for&rsquo; me as long as there are some that that are. Some in the queer political project believe in reshaping society to be inclusive of our identity, I just want to make space for us and have the space outside be nonthreatening. I sent the gender accessibility article to my partner and their only response was &lsquo;i hate that damn genderbread person&rsquo;. I hate the damn genderbread person too, it&rsquo;s cutesy and obnoxious. I think the conclusion of the article makes a good point and the recommendations are well put.</li>
