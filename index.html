            <p>Oh what a tangled web we weave. I&rsquo;m not really sure what&rsquo;s going on with this one or how I got here, I wanted to explore a search I had seen on Shodan called &ldquo;3cx servers bcn&rdquo; but now I&rsquo;m trapped in a digital hall of mirrors. 3CX is a private telephone exchange that sometimes runs over VoIP, and has servers that typically tend to run on 5001.

            <p>Today I&rsquo;m staying with a friend whose partner has a pretty serious media server set up (with 64TB! of content), and I thought I&rsquo;d take a look to see if I could find it on Shodan. And sure enough I could!
My Friend&rsquo;s Media Server on 104.172.240.189 So I had previously seen a Plex service running on an IP back on day 9, but I didn&rsquo;t investigate it too much because at the time I was focused on the irrigation system.</p>

            <p>In what I hope will become an infrequently regular feature I decided today to look for an already hacked server that had been defaced. I had found one in the process of defacement on my very first day, but the fully defaced ones are interesting largely because of the tags left by the hackers themselves. I&rsquo;m a little nervous about drawing attention to myself by publishing hacker tags in plaintext (easily found via Google alerts) so I&rsquo;ll mostly be doing that via images.</p>

            <p>Today I thought it might be fun to find an ATM, largely because I wanted to answer the question &ldquo;why connect an ATM to the internet with a static IP?&rdquo; I checked for past Shodan searches for ATMs to see if I could find anyone else looking for some so I would know what to look for, and I was able to find someone else looking for ATMs from a brand named NCR, which work over port 169.</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;m pretty busy today with Processing Day so I&rsquo;ll keep today&rsquo;s short. Shodan may be best known for finding strangers&rsquo; webcams, but I hadn&rsquo;t gone for one yet because early on in this project I decided that on days when I don&rsquo;t have a lot of time I&rsquo;d just find an unsecured webcam and grab a still image. Today is one of those days.

            <p>Another IoT home device today. At this point I&rsquo;m picturing the people with these things basically having a Wallace and Gromit style lifestyle (note: I do have a wifi plug and yes this is my lifestyle). This one was inspired by another search I didn&rsquo;t recognize, for &ldquo;Sonoff&rdquo;.
A Sonoff wifi enabled plug on 87.20.184.148 Sonoff is a company that makes IoT plugs and switches, as well as a couple of models of IoT fans and light bulbs.</p>

            <p>This is another find inspired by recent searches on Shodan. I saw searches &ldquo;FHEM Home Automation&rdquo; and I needed to know more.
Fhem Home Automation Server on 85.190.248.171 Every single result for FHEM was from Germany. So I picked the first one and got going. Looking up FHEM first on Google I found that it is an open source server software for doing home automation, built in perl and meant to be run on any kind of full time 24 /7 computer, like a Raspberry Pi.</p>

            <p>In honor of my spending about six hours on an airplane today I decided to search Shodan for &ldquo;satellite&rdquo; and, giving myself over to fate, pick the first result without looking at it.
The Email Server of a Long Defunct Conference at 163.44.163.77 Since I was inspired by the fact that my airplane is being serviced by satellite internet I was of course hoping that I would find the IP for a real actual space satellite, though I suspected I was more likely to find someone&rsquo;s satellite internet router or satellite dish.</p>

            <p>Today I saw a top search for something called &ldquo;GraphQL&rdquo;. Taking the bait on the unknown, I started looking.
A Startup Named Zipline&rsquo;s API Staging Space on 184.169.231.191 The first thing I noticed about GraphQL&rsquo;s distribution on Shodan was that it was all in the US. The second was that it was, by a huge margin, all in Ashburn, Virginia. After doing a quick google search I figured out that this is certainly because Amazon has so many datacenters there (leading it to be cheekily referred to as the &ldquo;center of the internet&rdquo;), and every GraphQL service seemed to be running on an Amazon EC2 instance.</p>
