            <p>Today I saw a top search for something called &ldquo;GraphQL&rdquo;. Taking the bait on the unknown, I started looking.
A Startup Named Zipline&rsquo;s API Testing Staging Space on 184.169.231.191 The first thing I noticed about GraphQL&rsquo;s distribution on Shodan was that it was all in the US. The second was that it was, by a huge margin, all in Ashburn, Virginia. After doing a quick google search I figured out that this is certainly because Amazon has so many datacenters there, and every GraphQL service seemed to be running on an Amazon EC2 instance.</p>

            <p>Today I went looking for MongoDB databases. I used MongoDB back in Shawn Van Every&rsquo;s servers class, I remember feeling pretty cool using a NoSQL database. Shodan indicated that MongoDB tends to work off of port 27017 so that&rsquo;s where I started looking.
The Shell of Someone&rsquo;s Machine Learning Blog on 35.185.145.24 I picked one of the first results I found on Shodan. According to Shodan it&rsquo;s located in Singapore and hosted on Google Cloud services.</p>

            <p>I was feeling listless today and a bit grumpy, so I decided to look for something that I could be motivationally upset about: automatic license plate readers (ALPRs). These are a kind of surveillance camera that are frequently used by police forces or parking facility managers to track cars and car movement. You might have seen a kind of them attached to traffic signal beams to catch red light runners, but they are used far more widely than just that.</p>

            <p>This is another one I found from looking at recent searches on Shodan. Someone searched for &ldquo;BlueSpray irrigation&rdquo; and I decided to follow their lead.
BlueSpray Wifi-Enabled Irrigation Controller (or maybe somebody&rsquo;s pentesting playground) on 71.52.48.61 BlueSpray is a startup that makes an internet of things irrigation system for the consumer level (so for suburban lawns, not farms). If &ldquo;internet of things lawn sprinkler&rdquo; makes your eyes roll all the way back into your head well then this blog is for you.</p>

            <p>A couple of days ago I noticed some people searching on Shodan for &ldquo;ETH: total speed&rdquo;. That didn&rsquo;t mean anything to me so I took note of it and today decided to dig in.
An Ethereum Miner on 186.90.40.229 Almost all the results I found for this search in Shodan were running off of port 3001 (the ones that weren&rsquo;t were on 9001), and tended to be in Russia, South Korea, or Ukraine.</p>

            <p>Someone tried to phish me yesterday via text from a Los Vegas phone number. Fortunately I was able to figure out their IP address and, yes, their IP is on Shodan. Someone Trying to Phish Me on 146.120.89.201 I started out checking both номе.рф and xn&ndash;e1ance.xn&ndash;p1ai, which is the address the text message actually links to. In case you are wondering, and don&rsquo;t want to read further, номе.рф is safe to go to in a browser but xn&ndash;e1ance.</p>

            <p>Today I decided to look for more industrial control systems, specifically Mitsubishi Q-Series logic controllers.
Yokohama Air Traffic Control Tower on 133.34.157.13 Reading about them on Shodan it looks like the Q-Series logic controllers tend to run off ports 5006 or 5007. So I did a search for those open ports. Judging from the results it looks like the majority of these Mitsubishi controllers are in Japan, not surprising I suppose since Mitsubishi is a Japanese company.</p>

            <p>Today I decided to go looking for MySQL databases. I&rsquo;ve always loved SQL, it was one of the first &ldquo;programming languages&rdquo; I learned and was a big part of one of my first jobs.
Institute of Industrial Organic Chemistry on 79.96.39.102 Checking with MySQL documents I found that MySQL databases typically run off of port 3306. So I went on Shodan to look for things with port 3306. One of the first results I saw was from Poland, and being Polish I couldn&rsquo;t resist poking around a bit in the homeland.</p>

            <p>Today I saw that the fifth most searched for term on Shodan of the day was &ldquo;dreambox&rdquo;. What a name! I couldn&rsquo;t resist! After a little digging I found that dreambox probably referred to a kind of linux-based television receiver, made by a German company with a truly fantastic logo. Cloned Dreambox Television Receiver on 84.39.177.219 I started out just searching on Shodan for &ldquo;dreambox&rdquo;, like so many others were doing today.</p>

            <p>Since I didn&rsquo;t do Minecraft servers yesterday I decided to do them today. First I read a little guide on how to set up a Minecraft server to get a sense of what they looked like.
Les Chevaliers Royale Minecraft Server on 97.94.56.211 I actually don&rsquo;t know much about Minecraft, I&rsquo;ve never played it. I know it&rsquo;s popular with a wide range of people, and that really dedicated players like to set up servers for group play, so I thought it might be interesting to look around for a server and figure out if I could find the people who were using it.</p>
