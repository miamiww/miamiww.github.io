            <p>Today I saw someone searching for &ldquo;SingTel&rdquo;, and had given a description of the search saying &ldquo;what? no auth? W o a h&rdquo;. Pretty compelling stuff, so I gave it a search myself. The actual query was a little more complicated, &ldquo;Server: Arcadyan httpd 1.0 200 OK org:&ldquo;Singtel Fibre Broadband&rdquo; &ldquo;.
An Unsecured Router on 219.74.62.124 Every result for the search was in Singapore, which I realized is because Singtel is one of the largest ISPs and mobile network providers in Singapore.</p>

            <p>Today I saw a search just for &ldquo;TVheadend&rdquo; and I thought it looked like a weird name so I decided to investigate.
TVheadened Server on 125.181.166.200 TVheadend is an open source streaming server and recorder for streaming television on Linux, FreeBSD, or Android machines. I believe it works by intercepting television input and putting it into streamable format, which means that the machine running this server would need some kind of cable or radio tv receiver (maybe even a Dreambox ðŸ˜„).</p>

            <p>Today&rsquo;s was a true delight, a real moment of striking gold, of finding something so beautifully weird that I can barely contain my excitement in writing this. Truly the spice of life, this. I started off wanting to find a wifi connected garage door, and I read that garage door openers are a common application of WebIOPi, which is a toolkit for Raspberry Pis to turn them into common IoT products via their GPIO pins.</p>

            <p>I saw someone&rsquo;s search for &ldquo;Synology DiskStation&rdquo; and even given our little foray into Synology back on day 20 I was ready to dive back into the world of the globe&rsquo;s premier network attached storage maker.
A Prototype of a Taiwanese Farm&rsquo;s Website on 114.34.78.222 The DiskStation promises &ldquo;personal cloud storage&rdquo; which to me sounds just like a personal server you connect to the internet, but maybe I&rsquo;m just old fashioned.</p>

A Raspberry Pi Digital Sign on 140.186.23.181 Screenly is a software for doing digital signage off of a Raspberry Pi. They have a &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; version for quite a bit of money ($20/month minumum but up to $800/month) and also an open source edition, which is what OSE stands for.</p>

            <p>Oh what a tangled web we weave. I&rsquo;m not really sure what&rsquo;s going on with this one or how I got here, I wanted to explore a search I had seen on Shodan called &ldquo;3cx servers bcn&rdquo; but now I&rsquo;m trapped in a digital hall of mirrors. 3CX is a private telephone exchange that sometimes runs over VoIP, and has servers that typically tend to run on 5001.

            <p>Today I&rsquo;m staying with a friend whose partner has a pretty serious media server set up (with 64TB! of content), and I thought I&rsquo;d take a look to see if I could find it on Shodan. And sure enough I could!
My Friend&rsquo;s Media Server on 104.172.240.189 So I had previously seen a Plex service running on an IP back on day 9, but I didn&rsquo;t investigate it too much because at the time I was focused on the irrigation system.</p>

            <p>In what I hope will become an infrequently regular feature I decided today to look for an already hacked server that had been defaced. I had found one in the process of defacement on my very first day, but the fully defaced ones are interesting largely because of the tags left by the hackers themselves. I&rsquo;m a little nervous about drawing attention to myself by publishing hacker tags in plaintext (easily found via Google alerts) so I&rsquo;ll mostly be doing that via images.</p>

            <p>Today I thought it might be fun to find an ATM, largely because I wanted to answer the question &ldquo;why connect an ATM to the internet with a static IP?&rdquo; I checked for past Shodan searches for ATMs to see if I could find anyone else looking for some so I would know what to look for, and I was able to find someone else looking for ATMs from a brand named NCR, which work over port 169.</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;m pretty busy today with Processing Day so I&rsquo;ll keep today&rsquo;s short. Shodan may be best known for finding strangers&rsquo; webcams, but I hadn&rsquo;t gone for one yet because early on in this project I decided that on days when I don&rsquo;t have a lot of time I&rsquo;d just find an unsecured webcam and grab a still image. Today is one of those days.
