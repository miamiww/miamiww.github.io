            <p>Saw a great search today, this for Unity Engine Web Players. Unity is a hugely popular 3D game engine, primarily used for making video games but has a wide range of applications, including workflow simulation, architectural prototyping, and filmmaking. Typically Unity outputs run as stand alone applications, but it also has the ability to output applications for the web via Web GL.
Unity Web GL on 52.15.155.102 There were about 600 results for this search and I picked the first result I found.</p>

            <p>I decided to double dip on AV receivers since someone was going so deep on them the past few days. Today I decided to look at Pioneer.
Pioneer AV Receiver on 167.142.82.87 I mostly know pioneer as a manufacturer of CDJs, and had no idea that they had a diverse product line beyond DJ equipment. They make bike equipment and accessories, a wide variety of audio equipment, and some kinds of computer electronics.</p>

            <p>I saw that someone was searching for quite a few different types of AV receivers today. I decided to look into one of their searches, this one for Yamaha receiver.
Yamaha AV Recievers on 90.149.252.214 I&rsquo;m not sure what the typical use-case for remote control of an AV receiver is. Maybe if you run a cafe and you want to make sure your untrustworthy employees don&rsquo;t make the music too loud while you&rsquo;re out?</p>

            <p>I saw someone searching for &ldquo;snapchat&rdquo; today. &ldquo;YOLO&rdquo;, I said to myself, and dived in.
Fujairah Innovation Mine on 83.111.19.71 The search was in fact pulling up some of Snapchat&rsquo;s production servers. Those were fairly boring however, though I did find something a little more interesting. This is a website for an organization called Fujairah Innovation Mine, which seems to be a typical tech startup incubator. The website was was running on port 7548 of the IP, so it clearly couldn&rsquo;t be the official version.</p>

A Mystery on 118.24.95.11 However I discovered this IP, I first arrived at what looked like a normal blog on port 8083. There is a very ~hacker~ image of a guy in ad hoody as the author&rsquo;s picture.</p>

            <p>Saw a search just for &ldquo;gmail.com&rdquo;, I assume to look for anyone who put their email address into their service. I decided to take a look.
A Torrenting Operation on 162.157.129.215 I like this search because it&rsquo;s device and service agnostic. I ended up just picking the first result and running with it, this one in Toronto. It turned out that the email address that brought me there belonged to the developer of a bittorent client named Deluge.</p>

            <p>A quick cam day today because I&rsquo;m a busy bee. I found a search awhile back for &ldquo;Auther: Steven Wu&rdquo;. Yes with the typo. It seems that Steven Wu wrote some server software for networked cameras back in maybe 2009 that is now used in a few different camera brands, all of which allow for snapshots to be taken without a password even if the video feed itself requires a password.</p>

            <p>Oh Minitel. I never expected to find you, here on the very World Wide Web that killed you.
3614 TEASER emulator on 62.210.93.204 I saw a recent search on Shodan for &ldquo;ttyd terminal shell&rdquo;. ttyd is a service for sharing your Terminal over the web, meaning that an insecure ttyd server would mean total access over someone&rsquo;s computer (assuming they were porting root). I decided to take a look. Of the 12 results most were just named &lsquo;ttyd - terminal&rsquo; and most of those were inactive, but one stood out.</p>

            <p>The Shodan recent searches is a well that never runs dry. Today I saw someone searching for &ldquo;Sickbeard&rdquo;. What could that possibly be??
Sickbeard TV on 85.145.200.210 The search was named Sickbeard but the actual search was for &ldquo;CherryPy/3.2.0rc1 This resource can be found at&rdquo;. Looking into it, CherryPy is a python based framework for running webapps. It looks useful and I think I&rsquo;ll log it into my toolkit for a later project.</p>

            <p>Saw an amazing search on Shodan today: someone searched for &ldquo;kiosk&rdquo; with the comment &ldquo;lotta cool stuff&rdquo;. Lotta cool stuff! How could I resist.
A Library Kiosk Management System on 104.239.140.99 Most of the kiosks seemed to be library kiosks, I even found one from my alma mater&rsquo;s library! I ended up going with the first one that I couldn&rsquo;t immediately figure out the purpose of. It was running some kind of web server on port 3000.</p>
