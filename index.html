						&ldquo;Trash carries dystopia within&rdquo; - Maite Zubiaurre
 The Future of Waste is a workshop for imagining no-waste futures, dystopian and otherwise.
slides
Why Technotrash? In technology-adjacent sustainability circles, often (not always!) the futures in which humans have solved their great ecological crises - garbage, energy, climate change - are depicted as a utopia at best and as a slightly better and more equitable version of the present at worst.&hellip;

					<time>Jun 13, 2019</time>
					<br><div class="description">
						
						Welcome! This is a list of resources to supplement my &ldquo;Basic Hacking in 2019 with Shodan&rdquo; workshop.
First it&rsquo;s very important to take care of yourself out there when you start poking around. I recommend a VPN to hide who you are a bit and some kind of browser tools to prevent someone from running malicious code in your browser.
My favorite VPN is Nord, and I use the uMatrix browser extension in all my browsers to control what code my browsers are running.&hellip;

					<time>Apr 12, 2019</time>
					<br><div class="description">
						
						Today I saw someone&rsquo;s search for BusyBox&rsquo;s, the query was &ldquo;port:9000 ash&rdquo;. BusyBox is a kind of GNU-lite system for embedded boards, allowing you to telnet into a shell that has most of the usual tools you get in Linux. It seems like it gets used in modems and stuff.
A BusyBox on 191.186.195.10 I picked the very first result, in Brazil. So it&rsquo;s not very interesting in some senses, it&rsquo;s just running a telnet port on 9000.&hellip;

						Today I just went looking for AWS servers.
AWS EC2 Instance on 35.154.190.199 The first one I found, in India, seemed pretty interesting. It had ssh running on port 22 and on 80 a webserver that just hosted a login. But this login page had a 15 second video loop with a giant watermark saying POND 5 on it. Turns out that POND 5 is a stock image/footage company and the fact that this video still has a giant watermark means that it certainly was not paid for.&hellip;

						I&rsquo;ve been feeling exhausted the past week, so I decided to take a couple of easy days reaching out to some webcams. I was hoping to see some people, looking at chiller stations all day can make you feel you a little lonely.
Internet Camera on 122.117.120.153 I found an IP in Taiwan that had two different cameras, one on 8000 and one on 9000. It seems to be in an internet cafe.&hellip;

					<time>Apr 5, 2019</time>
					<br><div class="description">
						
						About a week ago I saw a search for &ldquo;dgraph&rdquo; and I thought today I would take a look. Dgraph is a kind of graph database, which is a kind of NoSQL database with a graph-like structure of nodes and edges. The search was for &ldquo;Dgraph Ratel Dashboard&rdquo;.
Dgraph Server on 13.210.169.101 There were only 5 results, all either in China or Australia, and so I picked one in Australia because Dgraph is based in Sydney.&hellip;

					<br><div class="description">
						
						There&rsquo;s been a flurry of interesting recently shared searches on Shodan recently and I&rsquo;m just catching up with them. Today I looked into one for Raspberry Pis running SSH that was just &ldquo;port:22 &ldquo;raspbian&rdquo;&rdquo;. There are almost 100,000 results which I think goes to show just how popular these tiny computers are.
A Raspberry Pi on 178.12.106.221 I picked a result in Germany because I saw that in addition to SSH it was also running a webserver on 443.&hellip;

						Today I saw a search for the Microsoft Remote Desktop protocol. The search was for &ldquo;\x03\x00\x00\x0b\x06\xd0\x00\x00\x124\x00&rdquo;. ]
Microsoft Remote Desktop on 124.146.236.44 There were several hundred thousand results, showing just how popular the remote desktop protocol is. I remember using it quite often in a job I had several years ago. Initially I thought of looking for my old company&rsquo;s system but that seemed kind of like a weird thing to be doing.&hellip;

					<time>Mar 31, 2019</time>
					<br><div class="description">
						
						Saw a search today for &ldquo;Modbus Gateway&rdquo;. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what that would be exactly so I thought I&rsquo;d take a look.
Modbus Gateway on 82.143.179.14 Modbus is a protocol for communication over serial developed in 1979, originally meant for logic controllers, but now with wide use across industrial electronic devices. A modbus gateway is a device for connecting modbus devices into IP networks (sometimes the internet), typically so that they can be remotely monitored.&hellip;

					<br><div class="description">
						
						Today a search for &ldquo;unprotected WiMAX towers&rdquo;. The word tower was pretty tantalizing. The actual search was for &ldquo;OX253P&rdquo;.
WiMAX Tower on 117.244.48.33 WiMAX is a communication standard meant to give last mile wireless access to the internet to homes and businesses using microwaves. This would be a wireless alternative to DSL and cable internet, not requiring any cabling to the home endpoint, only a receiver antenna, much like LTE. It works much in the same way as cell towers, and frequently WiMAX and cell towers are bundled into one.&hellip;
