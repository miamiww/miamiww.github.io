            <p>Oh Minitel. I never expected to find you, here on the very World Wide Web that killed you.
3614 TEASER emulator on 62.210.93.204 I saw a recent search on Shodan for &ldquo;ttyd terminal shell&rdquo;. ttyd is a service for sharing your Terminal over the web, meaning that an insecure ttyd server would mean total access over someone&rsquo;s computer (assuming they were porting root). I decided to take a look. Of the 12 results most were just named &lsquo;ttyd - terminal&rsquo; and most of those were inactive, but one stood out.</p>

            <p>The Shodan recent searches is a well that never runs dry. Today I saw someone searching for &ldquo;Sickbeard&rdquo;. What could that possibly be??
Sickbeard TV on 85.145.200.210 The search was named Sickbeard but the actual search was for &ldquo;CherryPy/3.2.0rc1 This resource can be found at&rdquo;. Looking into it, CherryPy is a python based framework for running webapps. It looks useful and I think I&rsquo;ll log it into my toolkit for a later project.</p>

            <p>Saw an amazing search on Shodan today: someone searched for &ldquo;kiosk&rdquo; with the comment &ldquo;lotta cool stuff&rdquo;. Lotta cool stuff! How could I resist.
A Library Kiosk Management System on 104.239.140.99 Most of the kiosks seemed to be library kiosks, I even found one from my alma mater&rsquo;s library! I ended up going with the first one that I couldn&rsquo;t immediately figure out the purpose of. It was running some kind of web server on port 3000.</p>

            <p>As many of my days now start, I began my morning by looking through the recent searches on Shodan. I found one for Logitech devices that looked kind of interesting and dove in.
Logitech Media Server on 82.64.23.201 I no longer remember why I picked this particular device since I did my searching in the morning and am writing at night. I think I was impressed by the number of ports it had open.</p>

            <p>Today I saw someone had compiled a list of every Shodan-discovered server running in North Korea. To be honest I was a little surprised that there would be much outward-facing internet in North Korea, so I decided to take a look.
Media Ryugyong on 175.45.176.80 Most of the servers seemed to be mail servers, but some of them were running webpages. I picked the first one I found that was running a web page.</p>

            <p>Today I decided to go looking for for industrial control systems made by a company called Red Lion Controls. Red Lion makes controllers, touch screen operation panels, and a few other things besides. Reading Shodan I found that I could find them by searching for devices using port 789, which is the default port that Red Lion&rsquo;s software uses to communicate.
A Red Lion Controller on 166.167.27.6 I just went with the first result, this one somewhere in the US on a Verizon wireless mobile network, and immediately got sucked into figuring out whatever was going on with it.</p>

            <p>I saw a search on Shodan for &ldquo;Jetdirect&rdquo; with the tagline &ldquo;unsecured printers&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d recently heard a story about fans of the Youtuber PewDiePie using Shodan to hack into 50,000 printers to print messages about him so I thought maybe I could take a look and see maybe how they had done it.
HP Officejet Pro 8100 N811a on 121.161.211.66 Shodan showed 18,000 results for Jetdirect, with a plurality of them being in Korea.</p>

            <p>Today I decided to go looking for SCADA systems. SCADA stands for supervisory control and data acquisition and is a type of widely used industry management software, typically made bespoke for a particular factory or building. For a little more information I&rsquo;ll let the man himself, Carl Gould, take it away.   SCADA Building Automation System on 80.71.129.61 Not really sure how to find one, I just searched on Shodan for &ldquo;SCADA&rdquo; hoping to reap rewards with little research.</p>

CoinCircle&rsquo;s ICOStats Tracker on 165.227.6.170 Most of the results on Shodan are websites and webservers, but I found one running on Digital Ocean that&rsquo;s just a web app running on port 3000.</p>

B-I-A Vertriebs GmbH on 82.165.151.127 I ended up deciding on the web server run by a German wholesaler for electricity parts named B-I-A Vertriebs.</p>
