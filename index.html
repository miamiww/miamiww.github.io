            <p>Today&rsquo;s episode is again taken off of the recent searches. I saw someone searching for &ldquo;octoprint -login -authenticate&rdquo;, and decided I&rsquo;d take a look. Turns out OctoPrint is a web interface for 3D printers that let you remotely monitor and control your in progress jobs. So I&rsquo;d be finding 3D printers, a whole dimension up from the paper printer I found back on day 31.

            <p>I saw a search for &ldquo;prison phones&rdquo; and gosh if that isn&rsquo;t a lure I don&rsquo;t know what is. The search was just for &ldquo;encartele&rdquo;, and doing some Googling I found that Encartele is a major player in the United States inmate phone service industry. I think this ad will explain what that means:   An Encartele Prison Phone on 66.112.68.130 So Encartele charges inmates and their families artificially high phone rates and give paybacks to the wardens running the prisons.</p>

            <p>A plethora of good shared searches on Shodan today. I decided to go with satellite receiver web interfaces, thinking that after my attempts back on day 13 this would be about as close to a real satellite as I could get.
Leica Satellite Receiver on 212.39.114.78 I chose a result in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was running email ports and a webserver on port 80, so I took a look at the webserver.</p>

            <p>Today I felt like going for another hacked website, so I again searched for &ldquo;hacked by&rdquo; on Shodan like I did all the way back on day 18.
A Hacked Server on 94.76.219.226 There were so many results, I picked the first one I got, in the UK. It had ftp and ssh running, as well as email and the usual 80 and 443 webservers. It also had a cPanel login page running, cPanel being, in my experience, the most miserable way to run a webhost backend.</p>

            <p>Yes today I Shodaned myself. Nothing shows up for my full name, thankfully, but &ldquo;alden&rdquo; has a lot of results.
The Weather Underground on 35.160.169.47 I picked a result in Boardman, Oregon, largely because of how charming it was. It&rsquo;s just a telnet server, running on port 23 and mirrored on port 3000. You almost never see telnet anymore these days, since it&rsquo;s been primarily replaced with the much more secure ssh.</p>

            <p>I saw a search today for someone looking for spaceLYnk logic controllers, a kind of logic controller for SCADA systems made by Schneider Electric (SCADA, if you remember from day 30, stands for supervisory control and data acquisition).
spaceLYnk SCADA System on 213.6.102.238 There were quite a few results from all over the place, but I noticed that most of them didn&rsquo;t have visualizations of the system. So I picked one that had the whole system mapped out, in Palestine.</p>

            <p>Some Cisco routers say &ldquo;SAN FRANCISCO&rdquo; when telneting into them, and so someone had searched for that on Shodan looking for these routers (they say other things too of course, but that&rsquo;s just an easily searchable commonality). That kind of dragnet obviously pulls in a lot of other stuff too and I was particularly taken with one result.
An Ornamental Hermit on 74.207.243.202 What caught my eye on this IP was that Shodan was indicating that it was running gopher on port 70.</p>

            <p>I read this old blog post from 2015 talking about how many internet connected pumps at gas stations were vulnerable to hacking. I wanted to see if anything had really changed in the last four years.
Automated Tank Gauge on 81.248.205.246 Based on that blog post it seemed that the best thing to search for was &ldquo;I20100&rdquo;. I immediately found several thousand results and yes all of them seemed to be accessible.</p>

            <p>This past weekend I was speaking at the Schemers, Scammers, and Subverters Symposium in Portland, OR, and I asked the organizers if I could also run a prototype of my thesis at the event. Obviously I didn&rsquo;t describe it as such to them, in keeping with the spirit of the event I said that I had a fully polished performance ready named &ldquo;Future&rsquo;s Market&rdquo;. As part of the conference they were also running a market called &ldquo;The Totally Honest Barter Bazaar&rdquo;, and they told me I could take up a little corner of the room in order to hawk my wares.</p>

            <p>I had a red eye flight last night and am deliriously sleepy, and somewhere in this state bubbled up a strong desire to find an electronic highway billboard and read what it said remotely. I read Skyline makes internet connected billboards and use port 161. So I got searching.
A Skyline Sign on 173.4.137.205 Skyline manufactures quite a few different kinds of signs, but all of them are related to car transit.</p>
