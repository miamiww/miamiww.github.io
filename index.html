            <p>A quick webcam day as I was busy with a conference most of the day.
A Yawcam on 85.224.37.79 This time I went looking for &ldquo;yawcam&rdquo;, a webcam server software whose name stands for Yet Another Webcam. Like most free DIY webcam servers the default seems to be &ldquo;completely insecure&rdquo;, and I found quite a few interesting cameras, but chose one in Sweden that was running on port 8888. I love this because this person has so clearly come up with the exact perfect hack for their needs.</p>

            <p>To celebrate my 50th day and the fact that there haven&rsquo;t been any interesting new searches the past few days, I went to find an open RTSP video stream from an IP camera.
Security Camera on 85.143.138.242 Unfortunately after searching for awhile I only found one open stream, from Russia, and it wasn&rsquo;t particularly interesting. Definitely a warehouse or factory or some kind of industrial building. If only I could make out that sign in the upper corner.</p>

            <p>Another boring day on the shared searches. I decided to search for IPs with &ldquo;dev environment&rdquo; in the title, hoping to find something good.
Ace Attorney Online on 163.172.128.52 Many of the results were pretty interesting and I think it&rsquo;s a fruitful search overall, but one result in France stood out to me. It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;developer environment&rdquo; for a webpage running on port 8080 dedicated to fan-made versions of the popular Ace Attorney games.</p>

            <p>Kind of a weird one today. I didn&rsquo;t like any of the searches I&rsquo;d seen so I decided to search for anything that had &ldquo;production plant&rdquo; in the title.
A Woodchem Production Plant on 154.126.209.18 I wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure what I was looking for, but got several dozen results. I decided to pick one in South Africa. On port 80 it was running a login for a Dahua Technology device.</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;m busy preparing for a trip today and running errands so a quick one today. I found another Steven Wu webcam entirely by accident, just browsing Shodan&rsquo;s webserver snapshots (see day 38 if Steven Wu doesn&rsquo;t ring a bell). I like the Steven Wu cameras. The very simple interface, the snapshot approach. Feels right.
IP Camera on 110.5.43.249 The camera&rsquo;s webserver is running on port 81. Specifically what interested me about this webcam was its area of focus.</p>

            <p>Someone was really looking for GPONs today, as I saw at least three searches for GPON related devices. What&rsquo;s a GPON you wonder? Let&rsquo;s find out together.
VNPT GPON ONT on 14.161.15.80 GPON stands for Gigabit Passive Optical Network. Though the real details of how they work escape me, it seems that they are a commonly used device by ISPs to separate out cable traffic between customers, frequently referred to as the &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; between the ISP and the end customer.</p>

            <p>Another day another search. Today I found a shared search for &ldquo;emule&rdquo;. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s an emule?&rdquo; I asked myself, and dove in.
An eMule on 87.216.176.220 eMule is an &ldquo;electronic mule&rdquo;, duh. It&rsquo;s a kind of peer to peer software, different from bittorent, but I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how. Every explanation I&rsquo;ve found on how it works is a bit over my head, or at least over my attention span. It seemed like eMule was mostly popular in Europe, and I picked a result in Spain with eMule running on port 8000.</p>

            <p>Saw a great search today, this for Unity Engine Web Players. Unity is a hugely popular 3D game engine, primarily used for making video games but has a wide range of applications, including workflow simulation, architectural prototyping, and filmmaking. Typically Unity outputs run as stand alone applications, but it also has the ability to output applications for the web via Web GL.
Unity Web GL on 52.15.155.102 There were about 600 results for this search and I picked the first result I found.</p>

            <p>I decided to double dip on AV receivers since someone was going so deep on them the past few days. Today I decided to look at Pioneer.
Pioneer AV Receiver on 167.142.82.87 I mostly know pioneer as a manufacturer of CDJs, and had no idea that they had a diverse product line beyond DJ equipment. They make bike equipment and accessories, a wide variety of audio equipment, and some kinds of computer electronics.</p>

            <p>I saw that someone was searching for quite a few different types of AV receivers today. I decided to look into one of their searches, this one for Yamaha receiver.
Yamaha AV Recievers on 90.149.252.214 I&rsquo;m not sure what the typical use-case for remote control of an AV receiver is. Maybe if you run a cafe and you want to make sure your untrustworthy employees don&rsquo;t make the music too loud while you&rsquo;re out?</p>
