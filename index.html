            <p>For this assignment I fell off the generative text pathway and onto the well worn path of the media artist: bad generative music compositions with shiny new tools. On my Github feed I noticed that Rebecca Fiebrink had recently created a new repository called word2vec2osc and I realized that I could use word vectors plugged into Wekinator to train a bunch of sine wave generators to turn bodies of text into musical compositions.</p>

            <p>I don&rsquo;t like working over long breaks because - well - instead of making one finished project I have three projects that are halfway done. The first is the most complete but also the simplest, with Cambridge Analytica so in the news I couldn&rsquo;t resist doing something with one of my all time favorite videos, their talk at the Concordia Summit in 2016. I&rsquo;m surprised it took so long for their story to break.</p>

            <p>In keeping with my interests in human to machine learning interaction and in how individuals&rsquo; identities and personal narratives are shaped by those interactions, I decided to make a biometric scanning application (game?) that gives you your fortune based on the information it scans from you. My interest in algorithmic thinking and machine learning decision-making is manifesting as fortune telling projects because of the amount of predictive faith machine learning has culturally engendered: statistical pattern recognition as the new oracles, etc.</p>

            <p>When thinking of making my own poetic form I, in a fit of grandiose mania, decided that I would make my own form of generative epic poetry. Dactylic hexameter?&hellip; yes! Alliteration?&hellip; YES! Epithets?&hellip; YES YES!! Heroic narrative defining the moral values of my society?&hellip; YES YES YES!!!
Well it didn&rsquo;t really work out that well. The biggest problem is that narrative is really hard to pull off with generative and random-based methods.</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;ve been working with my iMessage history in order to do a sentiment analysis over time. In doing so I decided to start trying to randomly generate new texts that would kind of sound like me, much like the kind of creepy post-death chatbot made by training a neural net on all of your messages. My results weren&rsquo;t that&hellip; good, but there was enough structure there to hint at real language.</p>

            <p>In the first class I mentioned peñabots as an example of government social media manipulation. Rather than define them myself I&#8217;ll lean on the Wikipedia page definition: &#8220;the name given to what analysts believe to be a network of automated accounts on social media used by the Mexican government to spread pro-government propaganda and to marginalize dissenting opinions in social media&#8221;. Though not the first institutionally-organized trolling operation they stand apart for their sophistication, their effectiveness at shutting down oppositional organizing, and their use in a nominally non-authoritarian government (although one with a deep history of media manipulation).</p>

            <p>For my transcription exercise I wanted to pick something that was
a) short enough so that I could transcribe the whole thing
b) interesting enough that I wouldn&#8217;t mind listening to it over and over again
c) spoken slowly enough that I would only have to pause and rewind ten seconds 500 times and not 1000.

            <p>For my computational media final project I wanted to make a game about Cambridge Analytica and about the current cultural moment in data science and AI. I have seen the rise of the imperative to make one&#8217;s identity known and intelligible for collection online by various state and corporate actors as a sinister reach to further institutional control over the everyday, but I also think that the practice of psychographics is a silly pseudoscience.</p>

            <p>One of my favorite word games to play is to try to suss out the grey areas of meaning with seemingly well established words (e.g. what foot angle and distance of leaving the floor differentiates a &#8216;tap&#8217; from a &#8216;step&#8217;, in what ways are the aesthetic associations of a crypt different from those of a mausoleum). Kind of a useless semiotics examing the edge case value of a word (how much mist on a misty morning differentiates a bog from a swamp).</p>
