            <p>You can play Cybercaves 2: Return 2 Cybercave here. Setting out on making my original Twine game I had just wanted to play around and have a laugh, working with typical choose your own, cyberpunk, and text adventure genre conventions like so many Lego blocks. I also had two games on my mind: Porpetine&rsquo;s drown in 2 inches of humid bathbomb water, a game much more serious than mine but that uses Twine to ambigously shift between genres, and Frog Fractions, which I think of frequently as an apotheosis of a kind of cultural overflow, of media objects so steeped in referential circulationism that the joke becomes their own lack of essence.</p>

            <p>Whenever I imagine the world of the medium-term future looking back on the current time, say 75-100 years from now, which I do reasonably often, I imagine an intense future regret for now. It&rsquo;s a hard emotion to put into words. Maybe a kind of warm nostalgia combined with disgust, the way many Americans now view the 1950s, but mixed in with the sense that this time, the early 20XXs, was a time when wrong choices were made willfully in the face of evidence pointing toward right choices.</p>

            <p>I tried to continue on my theme of making a colossal cave adventure clone for voice, thinking that this time using the webhook fulfillment it would be much clearer what to do. I did get it functioning, somewhat. Unfortunately going south here should get you into the forest. I encountered numerous other bugs, such as items not appearing in the rooms they should be in, and getting stuck in a room permanently.</p>

            <p>Sandra I love the premise of Sandra but I can&rsquo;t help but wonder what kind of system could instantaneously categorize and direct all of these requests but couldn&rsquo;t formulate automated responses for most of them. Does it go more into detail about what ends up happening? There is something in the show about the current economy&rsquo;s preference for high-abstraction capital (algorithms, systems, connections) over labor, like the company Alia Shawkat is working for is the service economy equivalent of an old steel factory.</p>

            <p>The peculiarly named Grant Gore, a small triangular park at the intersection of Dean and Bedford in Crown Heights (&lsquo;gore&rsquo; being an obscure term for any small triangular park), is home to a truly massive bronze statue of Ulysses S Grant, Union hero of the Civil War and two term Reconstruction era president.
On a crisp morning this week I went to take a look at the statue. I was intrigued by the short bit of history I had read about it and the Gilded Age high society club that had commissioned it, but I also went because I wanted to unpack the inexplicable warmth I feel towards Grant.</p>

            <p>I made a draft of my field guide using the time honored &ldquo;paper prototype&rdquo; method. Corporate aesthetics, coming apart at the wheels. I used a hacky scan tool with Google photos to get these pictures of the draft since I didn&rsquo;t want to run in the rain to the library for a real scan, hence the weird banners, but I actually think they fit the overall aesthetic well, though it washed out the color a bit.</p>

            <p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been reading a ton of books with names like &ldquo;Cyber Dictionary: Your Guide To The Wired World&rdquo; or &ldquo;Net Chick: A Smart-Girl Guide to the Wired World&rdquo;, hip and breezy internet guide books written between 1996-2000. This has led to me making a few strange archive tools around the Internet Archive&rsquo;s Wayback Machine
The one I made for Hello Computer this week, a voice controlled archive navigation system, can be found here but unfortunately because I don&rsquo;t have HTTPS certification on my prototypes site Chrome will not allow you to access the microphone, so all you can see is the initial button.</p>

            <p>This week the phrase &ldquo;digital avatars&rdquo; has kept making me think of Digimon. I don&rsquo;t think Digimon ever really established what exactly happened to these kids when they entered the DigiWorld. Was their meatbody converted to bits and code? They pass back and forth between the barrier several times, which to me seems like a painful transition.
I worked with Nico and Kim doing 3D body scans with itSeez3D. We did a lot of scans.</p>

            <p>The websites I visit most frequently are a little boring. According to what Chrome, my browser, suggests, my number one visited website is Twitter, followed by the (in?)famous data journalism blog FiveThirtyEight, then ScaryGoRound.com which is a webcomic I&rsquo;ve been reading for almost 15 years, then Gmail (the Inbox flavor), then Github, and then my own blog which you are reading now. I think that last one is only because of how often I need to double check that my posts have actually made it online, not because of the love I have for my own posts.</p>
