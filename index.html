            <p>Today I saw someone searching for &ldquo;turbines&rdquo;. An intriguing search, certainly, and at first I thought that they were looking for wind turbines. No however it seems that whoever it was just randomly searched turbines. I decided to roll with it and see what came up.
B-I-A Vertriebs GmbH on 82.165.151.127 I ended up deciding on the web server run by a German wholesaler for electricity parts named B-I-A Vertriebs.</p>

            <p>Saw somebody doing a search for &ldquo;twonky&rdquo;. What a name! I had to find out about it.
A Twonky Media Server on 14.155.113.144 Twonky is one of many personal media servers I&rsquo;ve now run into, meant to run either on a network attached storage device or on a computer. The purpose I assume is to be able to stream your media from any devices on your network without having to worry about storying them locally (so if you&rsquo;ve stolen a lot of blueray movie rips from bittorent and want to watch them on your phone or something).</p>

            <p>The other day I saw someone on Shodan searching for &ldquo;udpxy&rdquo;, and I couldn&rsquo;t determine what was going on with that because all of the results would give me 401 no auth errors. Today I realized that I could, of course, add &ldquo;200 OK&rdquo; to the search and only return successful connections. So I did.
A Udpxy Server on 5.136.117.163 There were only two results, both in Russia, so I picked the one that seemed a little more interesting, from Tomsk, Siberia.</p>

            <p>Today I saw someone searching for &ldquo;SingTel&rdquo;, and had given a description of the search saying &ldquo;what? no auth? W o a h&rdquo;. Pretty compelling stuff, so I gave it a search myself. The actual query was a little more complicated, &ldquo;Server: Arcadyan httpd 1.0 200 OK org:&ldquo;Singtel Fibre Broadband&rdquo; &ldquo;.
An Unsecured Router on 219.74.62.124 Every result for the search was in Singapore, which I realized is because Singtel is one of the largest ISPs and mobile network providers in Singapore.</p>

            <p>Today I saw a search just for &ldquo;TVheadend&rdquo; and I thought it looked like a weird name so I decided to investigate.
TVheadened Server on 125.181.166.200 TVheadend is an open source streaming server and recorder for streaming television on Linux, FreeBSD, or Android machines. I believe it works by intercepting television input and putting it into streamable format, which means that the machine running this server would need some kind of cable or radio tv receiver (maybe even a Dreambox ðŸ˜„).</p>

            <p>Today&rsquo;s was a true delight, a real moment of striking gold, of finding something so beautifully weird that I can barely contain my excitement in writing this. Truly the spice of life, this. I started off wanting to find a wifi connected garage door, and I read that garage door openers are a common application of WebIOPi, which is a toolkit for Raspberry Pis to turn them into common IoT products via their GPIO pins.</p>

A Prototype of a Taiwanese Farm&rsquo;s Website on 114.34.78.222 The DiskStation promises &ldquo;personal cloud storage&rdquo; which to me sounds just like a personal server you connect to the internet, but maybe I&rsquo;m just old fashioned.</p>

A Raspberry Pi Digital Sign on 140.186.23.181 Screenly is a software for doing digital signage off of a Raspberry Pi. They have a &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; version for quite a bit of money ($20/month minumum but up to $800/month) and also an open source edition, which is what OSE stands for.</p>

            <p>Today I&rsquo;m staying with a friend whose partner has a pretty serious media server set up (with 64TB! of content), and I thought I&rsquo;d take a look to see if I could find it on Shodan. And sure enough I could!
My Friend&rsquo;s Media Server on 104.172.240.189 So I had previously seen a Plex service running on an IP back on day 9, but I didn&rsquo;t investigate it too much because at the time I was focused on the irrigation system.</p>
