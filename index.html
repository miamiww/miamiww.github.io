            <p>I&rsquo;m pretty busy today with Processing Day so I&rsquo;ll keep today&rsquo;s short. Shodan may be best known for finding strangers&rsquo; webcams, but I hadn&rsquo;t gone for one yet because early on in this project I decided that on days when I don&rsquo;t have a lot of time I&rsquo;d just find an unsecured webcam and grab a still image. Today is one of those days.
Someone&rsquo;s Webcam in Belgrade on 109.</p>

            <p>Another IoT home device today. At this point I&rsquo;m picturing the people with these things basically having a Wallace and Gromit style lifestyle (note: I do have a wifi plug and yes this is my lifestyle). This one was inspired by another search I didn&rsquo;t recognize, for &ldquo;Sonoff&rdquo;.
A Sonoff wifi enabled plug on 87.20.184.148 Sonoff is a company that makes IoT plugs and switches, as well as a couple of models of IoT fans and light bulbs.</p>

            <p>This is another find inspired by recent searches on Shodan. I saw searches &ldquo;FHEM Home Automation&rdquo; and I needed to know more.
Fhem Home Automation Server on 85.190.248.171 Every single result for FHEM was from Germany. So I picked the first one and got going. Looking up FHEM first on Google I found that it is an open source server software for doing home automation, built in perl and meant to be run on any kind of full time 24 /7 computer, like a Raspberry Pi.</p>

            <p>In honor of my spending about six hours on an airplane today I decided to search Shodan for &ldquo;satellite&rdquo; and, giving myself over to fate, pick the first result without looking at it.
The Email Server of a Long Defunct Conference at 163.44.163.77 Since I was inspired by the fact that my airplane is being serviced by satellite internet I was of course hoping that I would find the IP for a real actual space satellite, though I suspected I was more likely to find someone&rsquo;s satellite internet router or satellite dish.</p>

            <p>Today I saw a top search for something called &ldquo;GraphQL&rdquo;. Taking the bait on the unknown, I started looking.
A Startup Named Zipline&rsquo;s API Staging Space on 184.169.231.191 The first thing I noticed about GraphQL&rsquo;s distribution on Shodan was that it was all in the US. The second was that it was, by a huge margin, all in Ashburn, Virginia. After doing a quick google search I figured out that this is certainly because Amazon has so many datacenters there (leading it to be cheekily referred to as the &ldquo;center of the internet&rdquo;), and every GraphQL service seemed to be running on an Amazon EC2 instance.</p>

            <p>Today I went looking for MongoDB databases. I used MongoDB back in Shawn Van Every&rsquo;s servers class, I remember feeling pretty cool using a NoSQL database. Shodan indicated that MongoDB tends to work off of port 27017 so that&rsquo;s where I started looking.
The Shell of Someone&rsquo;s Machine Learning Blog on 35.185.145.24 I picked one of the first results I found on Shodan. According to Shodan it&rsquo;s located in Singapore and hosted on Google Cloud services.</p>

            <p>I was feeling listless today and a bit grumpy, so I decided to look for something that I could be motivationally upset about: automatic license plate readers (ALPRs). These are a kind of surveillance camera that are frequently used by police forces or parking facility managers to track cars and car movement. You might have seen a kind of them attached to traffic signal beams to catch red light runners, but they are used far more widely than just that.</p>

            <p>This is another one I found from looking at recent searches on Shodan. Someone searched for &ldquo;BlueSpray irrigation&rdquo; and I decided to follow their lead.
BlueSpray Wifi-Enabled Irrigation Controller (or maybe somebody&rsquo;s pentesting playground) on 71.52.48.61 BlueSpray is a startup that makes an internet of things irrigation system for the consumer level (so for suburban lawns, not farms). If &ldquo;internet of things lawn sprinkler&rdquo; makes your eyes roll all the way back into your head well then this blog is for you.</p>
