            <p>Today I&rsquo;ve been trying to write a paper about the waste industry and garbage, so I decided to search on Shodan just for the word &ldquo;garbage&rdquo; and see what I get.
Telnet Service on 62.133.200.27 There were about 100 results, most of them garbage themselves. But I found one in the Netherlands that perplexed me. It showed up in my Shodan search because Shodan had gotten the following response on port 7777:</p>

            <p>Today I saw a search on Shodan just for &ldquo;compressor station&rdquo;. Turns out that compressor stations are facilities for compressing natural gas so that it can be transported through a pipeline, and that a natural gas pipeline will frequently have many compressor stations to help keep things moving.
Natural Gas Compressor Station on 184.13.121.30 There were only 8 results, and I chose one in Fairmont, West Virginia because it was using Red Lion Controls, just like the oil field I found on day 32.</p>

            <p>Today I read about insecure video conferencing systems made by Polycom, and Googled up a Shodan query to find them. The query was &ldquo;polycom command shell&rdquo;.
Polycom Conference Calling System on 14.143.72.118 The results were all video conferencing devices that had open telnet ports, but I ultimately chose one in India that was runnign a webserver as well, so that I could have something more interesting to take pictures of.</p>

            <p>Today&rsquo;s the kind of day where I just don&rsquo;t remember how I found the IP I decided to write about. The dangers of looking in the morning and writing at night.
VoIP WiMAX Gateway on 115.167.115.93 Today&rsquo;s just a router. Well not &ldquo;just&rdquo; I router I suppose, it&rsquo;s a powerful router. The configuration page was running on port 8080, but fortunately for them they had a password and it wasn&rsquo;t a default.</p>

            <p>Today I saw a search for &ldquo;charging station&rdquo; and I thought I would take a look.
Electric Car Charging Station on 62.103.74.118 There seemed to be a variety of brands of devices that showed up, but all of them were charging stations for electric cars. I ended up picking one in Greece with no authentication. It was running a webserver on port 10000. I love this. It&rsquo;s a dashboard for an electric vehicle charging station made by Etrel, a Slovenian maker of such charging stations (here&rsquo;s the manual).</p>

            <p>I recently read about something called Jenkins, &ldquo;the leading open source automation server&rdquo;. The name and the logo reminded me of the now long gone Ask Jeeves, a search engine that I used when I was first getting online back in the 90s.
Jenkins Automation Server on 52.73.234.8 I just searched for &ldquo;Jenkins&rdquo; and looked around until I found a result without a login. It was in Ashburn, Virginia which almost certainly meant it was running on AWS in the giant Amazon server facility there.</p>

            <p>Today I just wanted to find a working public FTP server. So I searched &ldquo;FTP&rdquo;, and went with the first result I found, this one in Moscow.
FTP Server on 195.128.64.25 FTP seems like an ancient technology but I had a job just a few years ago where we would use it all of the time, and I frequently use it to move files to my servers when I can&rsquo;t be bothered to remember the correct scp syntax.</p>

            <p>Today I truly cast a stone into the sea blindfolded, and decided to see what typing in just any old random IP address into Shodan would bring up.
WampServer on 197.230.101.90 I&rsquo;m not sure what force compelled me to type 197.230.101.90, but it was indeed in Shodan and looked like it was running a website (80 and 443 were serving HTTP) and SQL databases (3306, the mySQL database port and 5432, the PostgreSQL port were both running).</p>

            <p>Busy today so I found an IP camera. This time I got one of my all time favorites, an AXIS camera, this one with a 4K resolution and 700° pan/tilt control.
AXIS Q6128-E Network Camera on 107.85.76.185 Shodan couldn&rsquo;t identify where it was beyond &ldquo;United States&rdquo;, and I found that was likely because it was connected to the network via a mobile Sierra AirLink router, the kind we&rsquo;ve seen several times now.</p>

            <p>I saw a great search on Shodan the other day, one just for Apache Webservers. Apache is a true classic, a webserver now 24 years old that had a big hand in the expansion of the early web. It&rsquo;s still among the most popular servers today; it&rsquo;s estimated that 20% of all current websites are running Apache.  So I was expecting to see a lot of results, and indeed Shodan could identify at least 320,000 IP addresses running Apache.</p>
