  <p class="post-summary">In the first class I mentioned peñabots as an example of government social media manipulation. Rather than define them myself I&#8217;ll lean on the Wikipedia page definition: &#8220;the name given to what analysts believe to be a network of automated accounts on social media used by the Mexican government to spread pro-government propaganda and to marginalize dissenting opinions in social media&#8221;. Though not the first institutionally-organized trolling operation they stand apart for their sophistication, their effectiveness at shutting down oppositional organizing, and their use in a nominally non-authoritarian government (although one with a deep history of media manipulation).</p>

  <p class="post-summary">For my transcription exercise I wanted to pick something that was
a) short enough so that I could transcribe the whole thing
b) interesting enough that I wouldn&#8217;t mind listening to it over and over again
c) spoken slowly enough that I would only have to pause and rewind ten seconds 500 times and not 1000.
I&#8217;d recently watched to MacKenzie Wark&#8217;s edutainment video on Chantal Mouffe for DIS magazine (now just DIS?</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Psychographic Categorization Neural Network Simulator 2000 </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">For my computational media final project I wanted to make a game about Cambridge Analytica and about the current cultural moment in data science and AI. I have seen the rise of the imperative to make one&#8217;s identity known and intelligible for collection online by various state and corporate actors as a sinister reach to further institutional control over the everyday, but I also think that the practice of psychographics is a silly pseudoscience.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Crypt vs Mausoleum </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">One of my favorite word games to play is to try to suss out the grey areas of meaning with seemingly well established words (e.g. what foot angle and distance of leaving the floor differentiates a &#8216;tap&#8217; from a &#8216;step&#8217;, in what ways are the aesthetic associations of a crypt different from those of a mausoleum). Kind of a useless semiotics examing the edge case value of a word (how much mist on a misty morning differentiates a bog from a swamp).</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Inspired by the near extinct website guestbook and completely extinct methods of phone phreaking, I wanted to make something that felt as unfinished and wide open with potential as the &#8220;old&#8221; web of 1992 &#8211; 2001.

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Haunted Dollhouse Planning </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">At this point I have gotten the basic Google home API working on my raspberry pi and have started manipulating the methods of interaction (changing the trigger word, changing the voices) and have started to work on building a specific Google home Action. Still to do is build the haunted dollhouse enclosure. Since the basic first interaction I want users to have with the haunted doll is to knock on the dollhouse door, I wanted to first set up a basic knock and open circuit.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Haunted Dolls and Things </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Recently I&#8217;ve been thinking mostly &#8211; but somewhat disjointedly &#8211; about haunted dolls as relational to AI and various societal-level fears. The doll as feminine artifact rendered creepy by autonomous movement and malicious intent is drawing parallels for me to visions of consumer-level AI &#8211; which frequently is embodied feminized labor &#8211; disrupting human civilization, both on the level of job displacement and as genocidal overlords. Many questions arise. At what depth of the uncanny valley does misogyny lie?</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Hi Five Machine </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">For our midterm Ridwan and I thought it would be really funny to make a machine that claims to give a high five but actually fakes you out every time.
Aesthetically it reminds me a bit of the toilet hand from Zelda.
Inside it has an arduino, two metal gear servos on a pan/tilt bracket meant for camera tracking controlling the hand, an HC- SR04 distance sensor, and an LCD screen.</p>
