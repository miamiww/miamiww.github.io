            <p>Today I saw a search for &ldquo;charging station&rdquo; and I thought I would take a look.
Electric Car Charging Station on 62.103.74.118 There seemed to be a variety of brands of devices that showed up, but all of them were charging stations for electric cars. I ended up picking one in Greece with no authentication. It was running a webserver on port 10000. I love this. It&rsquo;s a dashboard for an electric vehicle charging station made by Etrel, a Slovenian maker of such charging stations (here&rsquo;s the manual).</p>

            <p>I recently read about something called Jenkins, &ldquo;the leading open source automation server&rdquo;. The name and the logo reminded me of the now long gone Ask Jeeves, a search engine that I used when I was first getting online back in the 90s.
Jenkins Automation Server on 52.73.234.8 I just searched for &ldquo;Jenkins&rdquo; and looked around until I found a result without a login. It was in Ashburn, Virginia which almost certainly meant it was running on AWS in the giant Amazon server facility there.</p>

            <p>Today I just wanted to find a working public FTP server. So I searched &ldquo;FTP&rdquo;, and went with the first result I found, this one in Moscow.
FTP Server on 195.128.64.25 FTP seems like an ancient technology but I had a job just a few years ago where we would use it all of the time, and I frequently use it to move files to my servers when I can&rsquo;t be bothered to remember the correct scp syntax.</p>

            <p>Today I truly cast a stone into the sea blindfolded, and decided to see what typing in just any old random IP address into Shodan would bring up.
WampServer on 197.230.101.90 I&rsquo;m not sure what force compelled me to type 197.230.101.90, but it was indeed in Shodan and looked like it was running a website (80 and 443 were serving HTTP) and SQL databases (3306, the mySQL database port and 5432, the PostgreSQL port were both running).</p>

            <p>Busy today so I found an IP camera. This time I got one of my all time favorites, an AXIS camera, this one with a 4K resolution and 700Â° pan/tilt control.
AXIS Q6128-E Network Camera on 107.85.76.185 Shodan couldn&rsquo;t identify where it was beyond &ldquo;United States&rdquo;, and I found that was likely because it was connected to the network via a mobile Sierra AirLink router, the kind we&rsquo;ve seen several times now.</p>

            <p>I saw a great search on Shodan the other day, one just for Apache Webservers. Apache is a true classic, a webserver now 24 years old that had a big hand in the expansion of the early web. It&rsquo;s still among the most popular servers today; it&rsquo;s estimated that 20% of all current websites are running Apache.  So I was expecting to see a lot of results, and indeed Shodan could identify at least 320,000 IP addresses running Apache.</p>

            <p>Today I saw a search just for everything that&rsquo;s a customer of PT Telkom Indonesia, an Indonesian ISP.
Tuban Cement Factory on 180.250.182.241 I ended up picking the first result because I saw on Shodan, in the town of Tuban on Java, that it was running this warning on the telnet port, 23.

After looking at the results for awhile I found that there was a particular type of object that showed up that I thought was worth looking into further, what looked like a &ldquo;smart projector&rdquo;.
Optoma on 54.223.86.54 The actual search I used to narrow down on the projectors was &ldquo;alxtest/alexa&rdquo;, which was part of the name in the webserver these projectors were running.</p>

            <p>Today I saw a search for Iomega (now Lenovo EMC) Network Attached Storage, probably because these devices have been show to have huge security flaws (or the novelty of finding devices that still have &ldquo;Iomega&rdquo; written into their cookie code even after the brand had been incorporated into Lenovo). But I thought it would be a nice change from all of the Synology NAS we&rsquo;ve been seeing.

            <p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of hubbub in the infosec world the past couple of days because the NSA released one of their reverse engineering tools, Ghidra, as an open source toolkit. This is huge news because the closest tool in functionality, IDA Pro, is $1200 a year for a license, but also raised a question: would you trust software from the NSA, even if it&rsquo;s hosted on Github? I&rsquo;m starting with this preamble because of a default setting in Ghidra.</p>
