            <p>This past weekend I was speaking at the Schemers, Scammers, and Subverters Symposium in Portland, OR, and I asked the organizers if I could also run a prototype of my thesis at the event. Obviously I didn&rsquo;t describe it as such to them, in keeping with the spirit of the event I said that I had a fully polished performance ready named &ldquo;Future&rsquo;s Market&rdquo;. As part of the conference they were also running a market called &ldquo;The Totally Honest Barter Bazaar&rdquo;, and they told me I could take up a little corner of the room in order to hawk my wears.</p>

            <p>I had a red eye flight last night and am deliriously sleepy, and somewhere in this state bubbled up a strong desire to find an electronic highway billboard and read what it said remotely. I read Skyline makes internet connected billboards and use port 161. So I got searching.
A Skyline Sign on 173.4.137.205 Skyline manufactures quite a few different kinds of signs, but all of them are related to car transit.</p>

            <p>I saw an amazing search on Shodan today, it was just named &ldquo;self-explanatory&rdquo; and the search was just for the word &ldquo;losers&rdquo;. How could I say no?
Littleborough Losers on 94.7.201.171 The results were pretty varied, there&rsquo;s apparently a sex kink that has to do with being dominated and called a loser and so quite a few results were communities related to that, but I found a result in England that more closely fits my particular kink: 90s web design.</p>

            <p>A quick webcam day as I was busy with a conference most of the day.
A Yawcam on 85.224.37.79 This time I went looking for &ldquo;yawcam&rdquo;, a webcam server software whose name stands for Yet Another Webcam. Like most free DIY webcam servers the default seems to be &ldquo;completely insecure&rdquo;, and I found quite a few interesting cameras, but chose one in Sweden that was running on port 8888. I love this because this person has so clearly come up with the exact perfect hack for their needs.</p>

            <p>To celebrate my 50th day and the fact that there haven&rsquo;t been any interesting new searches the past few days, I went to find an open RTSP video stream from an IP camera.
Security Camera on 85.143.138.242 Unfortunately after searching for awhile I only found one open stream, from Russia, and it wasn&rsquo;t particularly interesting. Definitely a warehouse or factory or some kind of industrial building. If only I could make out that sign in the upper corner.</p>

            <p>Another boring day on the shared searches. I decided to search for IPs with &ldquo;dev environment&rdquo; in the title, hoping to find something good.
Ace Attorney Online on 163.172.128.52 Many of the results were pretty interesting and I think it&rsquo;s a fruitful search overall, but one result in France stood out to me. It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;developer environment&rdquo; for a webpage running on port 8080 dedicated to fan-made versions of the popular Ace Attorney games.</p>

            <p>Kind of a weird one today. I didn&rsquo;t like any of the searches I&rsquo;d seen so I decided to search for anything that had &ldquo;production plant&rdquo; in the title.
A Woodchem Production Plant on 154.126.209.18 I wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure what I was looking for, but got several dozen results. I decided to pick one in South Africa. On port 80 it was running a login for a Dahua Technology device.</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;m busy preparing for a trip today and running errands so a quick one today. I found another Steven Wu webcam entirely by accident, just browsing Shodan&rsquo;s webserver snapshots (see day 38 if Steven Wu doesn&rsquo;t ring a bell). I like the Steven Wu cameras. The very simple interface, the snapshot approach. Feels right.
IP Camera on 110.5.43.249 The camera&rsquo;s webserver is running on port 81. Specifically what interested me about this webcam was its area of focus.</p>

            <p>Someone was really looking for GPONs today, as I saw at least three searches for GPON related devices. What&rsquo;s a GPON you wonder? Let&rsquo;s find out together.
VNPT GPON ONT on 14.161.15.80 GPON stands for Gigabit Passive Optical Network. Though the real details of how they work escape me, it seems that they are a commonly used device by ISPs to separate out cable traffic between customers, frequently referred to as the &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; between the ISP and the end customer.</p>

            <p>Another day another search. Today I found a shared search for &ldquo;emule&rdquo;. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s an emule?&rdquo; I asked myself, and dove in.
An eMule on 87.216.176.220 eMule is an &ldquo;electronic mule&rdquo;, duh. It&rsquo;s a kind of peer to peer software, different from bittorent, but I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how. Every explanation I&rsquo;ve found on how it works is a bit over my head, or at least over my attention span. It seemed like eMule was mostly popular in Europe, and I picked a result in Spain with eMule running on port 8000.</p>
