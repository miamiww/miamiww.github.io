            <p>A couple of days ago I noticed some people searching on Shodan for &ldquo;ETH: total speed&rdquo;. That didn&rsquo;t mean anything to me so I took note of it and today decided to dig in.
An Ethereum Miner on 186.90.40.229 Almost all the results I found for this search in Shodan were running off of port 3001 (the ones that weren&rsquo;t were on 9001), and tended to be in Russia, South Korea, or Ukraine.</p>

            <p>Someone tried to phish me yesterday via text from a Los Vegas phone number. Fortunately I was able to figure out their IP address and, yes, their IP is on Shodan. Someone Trying to Phish Me on 146.120.89.201 I started out checking both номе.рф and xn&ndash;e1ance.xn&ndash;p1ai, which is the address the text message actually links to. In case you are wondering, and don&rsquo;t want to read further, номе.рф is safe to go to in a browser but xn&ndash;e1ance.</p>

            <p>Today I decided to look for more industrial control systems, specifically Mitsubishi Q-Series logic controllers.
Yokohama Air Traffic Control Tower on 133.34.157.13 Reading about them on Shodan it looks like the Q-Series logic controllers tend to run off ports 5006 or 5007. So I did a search for those open ports. Judging from the results it looks like the majority of these Mitsubishi controllers are in Japan, not surprising I suppose since Mitsubishi is a Japanese company.</p>

            <p>Today I decided to go looking for MySQL databases. I&rsquo;ve always loved SQL, it was one of the first &ldquo;programming languages&rdquo; I learned and was a big part of one of my first jobs.
Institute of Industrial Organic Chemistry on 79.96.39.102 Checking with MySQL documents I found that MySQL databases typically run off of port 3306. So I went on Shodan to look for things with port 3306. One of the first results I saw was from Poland, and being Polish I couldn&rsquo;t resist poking around a bit in the homeland.</p>

            <p>Today I saw that the fifth most searched for term on Shodan of the day was &ldquo;dreambox&rdquo;. What a name! I couldn&rsquo;t resist! After a little digging I found that dreambox probably referred to a kind of linux-based television receiver, made by a German company with a truly fantastic logo. Cloned Dreambox Television Receiver on 84.39.177.219 I started out just searching on Shodan for &ldquo;dreambox&rdquo;, like so many others were doing today.</p>

            <p>Since I didn&rsquo;t do Minecraft servers yesterday I decided to do them today. First I read a little guide on how to set up a Minecraft server to get a sense of what they looked like.
Les Chevaliers Royale Minecraft Server on 97.94.56.211 I actually don&rsquo;t know much about Minecraft, I&rsquo;ve never played it. I know it&rsquo;s popular with a wide range of people, and that really dedicated players like to set up servers for group play, so I thought it might be interesting to look around for a server and figure out if I could find the people who were using it.</p>

            <p>Today I had two quick ideas for what to look for, either industrial control systems or minecraft servers. Flipping a coin, ICS won out. Reading a quick Shodan guide on them I decided to look for Siemens control systems, for no reason other than I&rsquo;d heard of them before.
Joann Fabric&rsquo;s Industrial Control System on 208.83.32.213 Siemens has a proprietary network protocol called S7 Communications that they use for their Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), which they also provide a nice sales brochure for.</p>

            <p>A note up front:
Generally I&rsquo;ve been struggling with an ethical question of this project, should I be publishing the IP addresses and personal identification of individual people I find? I can&rsquo;t imagine that anyone reading this would take that info and do anything untoward with it, but it&rsquo;s an odd stance on surveillance culture to dox strangers meaninglessly, even if the ability to reach out and randomly touching a stranger is the reality of networked existence.</p>

Heaven Is A Waste Place is a simulated corporation, The Ongoing Now Corporation, and the space in which it is simulated. It is part office role play and part doomsday cult.

            <p>Inspired in part by seasteaders and other such cults which are entirely engaged in a utopia-building project even if that utopia looks like a nightmare to outsiders, I&rsquo;ve begun building my own mythology of The Ongoing Now Corporation.
TON Corp is a corporate cult created by Theong Oingnow for the purpose of preparing for the Bow Sink, the day that Noah&rsquo;s ark finally capsizes.
Preparations include the collection, analysis, and categorization of various discarded objects.</p>
