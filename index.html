            <p>Today I decided to go looking for MySQL databases. I&rsquo;ve always loved SQL, it was one of the first &ldquo;programming languages&rdquo; I learned and was a big part of one of my first jobs.
Institute of Industrial Organic Chemistry on 79.96.39.102 Checking with MySQL documents I found that MySQL databases typically run off of port 3306. So I went on Shodan to look for things with port 3306. One of the first results I saw was from Poland, and being Polish I couldn&rsquo;t resist poking around a bit in the homeland.</p>

            <p>Today I saw that the fifth most searched for term on Shodan of the day was &ldquo;dreambox&rdquo;. What a name! I couldn&rsquo;t resist! After a little digging I found that dreambox probably referred to a kind of linux-based television receiver, made by a German company with a truly fantastic logo. Cloned Dreambox Television Receiver on 84.39.177.219 I started out just searching on Shodan for &ldquo;dreambox&rdquo;, like so many others were doing today.</p>

            <p>Since I didn&rsquo;t do Minecraft servers yesterday I decided to do them today. First I read a little guide on how to set up a Minecraft server to get a sense of what they looked like.
Les Chevaliers Royale Minecraft Server on 97.94.56.211 I actually don&rsquo;t know much about Minecraft, I&rsquo;ve never played it. I know it&rsquo;s popular with a wide range of people, and that really dedicated players like to set up servers for group play, so I thought it might be interesting to look around for a server and figure out if I could find the people who were using it.</p>

            <p>Today I had two quick ideas for what to look for, either industrial control systems or minecraft servers. Flipping a coin, ICS won out. Reading a quick Shodan guide on them I decided to look for Siemens control systems, for no reason other than I&rsquo;d heard of them before.
Joann Fabric&rsquo;s Industrial Control System on 208.83.32.213 Siemens has a proprietary network protocol called S7 Communications that they use for their Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), which they also provide a nice sales brochure for.</p>

            <p>A note up front:
Generally I&rsquo;ve been struggling with an ethical question of this project, should I be publishing the IP addresses and personal identification of individual people I find? I can&rsquo;t imagine that anyone reading this would take that info and do anything untoward with it, but it&rsquo;s an odd stance on surveillance culture to dox strangers meaninglessly, even if the ability to reach out and randomly touching a stranger is the reality of networked existence.</p>

Heaven Is A Waste Place is a simulated corporation, The Ongoing Now Corporation, and the space in which it is simulated. It is part office role play and part doomsday cult. The goal of TONCO and its employees is to find new uses for waste after the apocalypse, and maybe a new, more holy way of life.</p>

            <p>Inspired in part by seasteaders and other such cults which are entirely engaged in a utopia-building project even if that utopia looks like a nightmare to outsiders, I&rsquo;ve begun building my own mythology of The Ongoing Now Corporation.
TON Corp is a corporate cult created by Theong Oingnow for the purpose of preparing for the Bow Sink, the day that Noah&rsquo;s ark finally capsizes.
Preparations include the collection, analysis, and categorization of various discarded objects.</p>

            <p>Beverly and I decided to work on a quick VJing system. We started out doing research and interviewed a few people on the floor to ask them what they thought made for good VJing, and what made for bad VJing. The most consistent thing we heard was that the visuals should match the mood and timing of the music. Since beat syncing the visuals to the music might be hard with REST we decided to have two &ldquo;modes&rdquo; for the system, GIF mode and visuals mode.</p>

The TP-Link at 192.168.0.1 is, naturally, my router. The TP-Link at .100 is actually my wifi-enabled plug from the same manufacturer. The Amazon Technologies device is an Echo (running 64 bit Linux? I thought they ran &lsquo;Amazon Fire&rsquo; EDIT: looks like Fire OS has a Linux kernel), The Canon is a printer, the Pis are actually a single Pi connected via both wifi and ethernet.</p>
