			<p>In keeping with my interests in human to machine learning interaction and in how individuals' identities and personal narratives are shaped by those interactions, I decided to make a biometric scanning application (game?) that gives you your fortune based on the information it scans from you. My interest in algorithmic thinking and machine learning decision-making is manifesting as fortune telling projects because of the amount of predictive faith machine learning has culturally engendered: statistical pattern recognition as the new oracles, etc.</p>
<p>You can see the project <a href="https://arj247.itp.io/">here</a></p>
<p>I want to keep working on this, the interface could use some polish and right now the scripts are basic and random. I&rsquo;m not one for making slick web applications for my projects but I want to play on and play with those dominant web aesthetics. Right now it&rsquo;s a little UX brutalist just by default but I think I could push it further in that direction.</p>
<p>All code <a href="https://github.com/miamiww/ServerDWD/tree/master/final_project">here on my Github</a></p>
