      <description>You can play Cybercaves 2: Return 2 Cybercave here. Setting out on making my original Twine game I had just wanted to play around and have a laugh, working with typical choose your own, cyberpunk, and text adventure genre conventions like so many Lego blocks. I also had two games on my mind: Porpetine&amp;rsquo;s drown in 2 inches of humid bathbomb water, a game much more serious than mine but that uses Twine to ambigously shift between genres, and Frog Fractions, which I think of frequently as an apotheosis of a kind of cultural overflow, of media objects so steeped in referential circulationism that the joke becomes their own lack of essence.</description>
