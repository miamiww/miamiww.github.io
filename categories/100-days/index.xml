      <description>Oh Minitel. I never expected to find you, here on the very World Wide Web that killed you.
3614 TEASER emulator on 62.210.93.204 I saw a recent search on Shodan for &amp;ldquo;ttyd terminal shell&amp;rdquo;. ttyd is a service for sharing your Terminal over the web, meaning that an insecure ttyd server would mean total access over someone&amp;rsquo;s computer (assuming they were porting root). I decided to take a look. Of the 12 results most were just named &amp;lsquo;ttyd - terminal&amp;rsquo; and most of those were inactive, but one stood out.</description>

      <title>Shodan Stories Day 36: A Sick Beard in Hilversum, Usenet Is Still Around, Torrenting SuperUsers, and How Much of the Internet Is Just People Trying to Watch TV?</title>

      <description>The Shodan recent searches is a well that never runs dry. Today I saw someone searching for &amp;ldquo;Sickbeard&amp;rdquo;. What could that possibly be??
Sickbeard TV on 85.145.200.210 The search was named Sickbeard but the actual search was for &amp;ldquo;CherryPy/3.2.0rc1 This resource can be found at&amp;rdquo;. Looking into it, CherryPy is a python based framework for running webapps. It looks useful and I think I&amp;rsquo;ll log it into my toolkit for a later project.</description>

      <description>Saw an amazing search on Shodan today: someone searched for &amp;ldquo;kiosk&amp;rdquo; with the comment &amp;ldquo;lotta cool stuff&amp;rdquo;. Lotta cool stuff! How could I resist.
A Library Kiosk Management System on 104.239.140.99 Most of the kiosks seemed to be library kiosks, I even found one from my alma mater&amp;rsquo;s library! I ended up going with the first one that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t immediately figure out the purpose of. It was running some kind of web server on port 3000.</description>

      <description>As many of my days now start, I began my morning by looking through the recent searches on Shodan. I found one for Logitech devices that looked kind of interesting and dove in.
Logitech Media Server on 82.64.23.201 I no longer remember why I picked this particular device since I did my searching in the morning and am writing at night. I think I was impressed by the number of ports it had open.</description>

      <description>Today I saw someone had compiled a list of every Shodan-discovered server running in North Korea. To be honest I was a little surprised that there would be much outward-facing internet in North Korea, so I decided to take a look.
Media Ryugyong on 175.45.176.80 Most of the servers seemed to be mail servers, but some of them were running webpages. I picked the first one I found that was running a web page.</description>

      <title>Shodan Stories Day 32: Red Lion Industrial Controls in a Remote US Location, Riding the XetaWave, the AirLink ACEmanager, Tank Batteries, and the Stack Overflow Answer that Launched 6000 Redirects</title>

      <guid>http://blog.alden.website/post/100days/Day-32/</guid>
      <description>Today I decided to go looking for for industrial control systems made by a company called Red Lion Controls. Red Lion makes controllers, touch screen operation panels, and a few other things besides. Reading Shodan I found that I could find them by searching for devices using port 789, which is the default port that Red Lion&amp;rsquo;s software uses to communicate.
A Red Lion Controller on 166.167.27.6 I just went with the first result, this one somewhere in the US on a Verizon wireless mobile network, and immediately got sucked into figuring out whatever was going on with it.</description>

      <description>I saw a search on Shodan for &amp;ldquo;Jetdirect&amp;rdquo; with the tagline &amp;ldquo;unsecured printers&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;d recently heard a story about fans of the Youtuber PewDiePie using Shodan to hack into 50,000 printers to print messages about him so I thought maybe I could take a look and see maybe how they had done it.
HP Officejet Pro 8100 N811a on 121.161.211.66 Shodan showed 18,000 results for Jetdirect, with a plurality of them being in Korea.</description>

      <title>Shodan Stories Day 30: Automating Buildings in Copenhagen, the BAS SCADA Industry, Expandable Controllers, CloriÅ«s, KeRo, and O&amp;J CTS A/S</title>

      <guid>http://blog.alden.website/post/100days/Day-30/</guid>
      <description>Today I decided to go looking for SCADA systems. SCADA stands for supervisory control and data acquisition and is a type of widely used industry management software, typically made bespoke for a particular factory or building. For a little more information I&amp;rsquo;ll let the man himself, Carl Gould, take it away.   SCADA Building Automation System on 80.71.129.61 Not really sure how to find one, I just searched on Shodan for &amp;ldquo;SCADA&amp;rdquo; hoping to reap rewards with little research.</description>

      <description>I saw someone searching for &amp;ldquo;ICO&amp;rdquo;. At first I thought maybe it had something to do with the groundbreaking 2001 indie game, but after browsing some links I realized that no, it meant &amp;ldquo;Initial Coin Offering&amp;rdquo;, and yes this is another crypto thing.
CoinCircle&amp;rsquo;s ICOStats Tracker on 165.227.6.170 Most of the results on Shodan are websites and webservers, but I found one running on Digital Ocean that&amp;rsquo;s just a web app running on port 3000.</description>

      <description>Today I saw someone searching for &amp;ldquo;turbines&amp;rdquo;. An intriguing search, certainly, and at first I thought that they were looking for wind turbines. No however it seems that whoever it was just randomly searched turbines. I decided to roll with it and see what came up.
B-I-A Vertriebs GmbH on 82.165.151.127 I ended up deciding on the web server run by a German wholesaler for electricity parts named B-I-A Vertriebs.</description>

      <description>Saw somebody doing a search for &amp;ldquo;twonky&amp;rdquo;. What a name! I had to find out about it.
A Twonky Media Server on 14.155.113.144 Twonky is one of many personal media servers I&amp;rsquo;ve now run into, meant to run either on a network attached storage device or on a computer. The purpose I assume is to be able to stream your media from any devices on your network without having to worry about storying them locally (so if you&amp;rsquo;ve stolen a lot of blueray movie rips from bittorent and want to watch them on your phone or something).</description>

      <description>The other day I saw someone on Shodan searching for &amp;ldquo;udpxy&amp;rdquo;, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t determine what was going on with that because all of the results would give me 401 no auth errors. Today I realized that I could, of course, add &amp;ldquo;200 OK&amp;rdquo; to the search and only return successful connections. So I did.
A Udpxy Server on 5.136.117.163 There were only two results, both in Russia, so I picked the one that seemed a little more interesting, from Tomsk, Siberia.</description>

      <guid>http://blog.alden.website/post/100days/Day-25/</guid>
      <description>Today I saw someone searching for &amp;ldquo;SingTel&amp;rdquo;, and had given a description of the search saying &amp;ldquo;what? no auth? W o a h&amp;rdquo;. Pretty compelling stuff, so I gave it a search myself. The actual query was a little more complicated, &amp;ldquo;Server: Arcadyan httpd 1.0 200 OK org:&amp;ldquo;Singtel Fibre Broadband&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;.
An Unsecured Router on 219.74.62.124 Every result for the search was in Singapore, which I realized is because Singtel is one of the largest ISPs and mobile network providers in Singapore.</description>

      <description>Today I saw a search just for &amp;ldquo;TVheadend&amp;rdquo; and I thought it looked like a weird name so I decided to investigate.
TVheadened Server on 125.181.166.200 TVheadend is an open source streaming server and recorder for streaming television on Linux, FreeBSD, or Android machines. I believe it works by intercepting television input and putting it into streamable format, which means that the machine running this server would need some kind of cable or radio tv receiver (maybe even a Dreambox ð).</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s was a true delight, a real moment of striking gold, of finding something so beautifully weird that I can barely contain my excitement in writing this. Truly the spice of life, this. I started off wanting to find a wifi connected garage door, and I read that garage door openers are a common application of WebIOPi, which is a toolkit for Raspberry Pis to turn them into common IoT products via their GPIO pins.</description>

      <description>I saw someone&amp;rsquo;s search for &amp;ldquo;Synology DiskStation&amp;rdquo; and even given our little foray into Synology back on day 20 I was ready to dive back into the world of the globe&amp;rsquo;s premier network attached storage maker.
A Prototype of a Taiwanese Farm&amp;rsquo;s Website on 114.34.78.222 The DiskStation promises &amp;ldquo;personal cloud storage&amp;rdquo; which to me sounds just like a personal server you connect to the internet, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just old fashioned.</description>

      <description>Today I saw someone searching for &amp;ldquo;Screenly OSE&amp;rdquo; and actually gave a description for their search saying &amp;ldquo;screenly ose for the pi, think of a billboard system&amp;rdquo;. So I gave it a go.
A Raspberry Pi Digital Sign on 140.186.23.181 Screenly is a software for doing digital signage off of a Raspberry Pi. They have a &amp;ldquo;Pro&amp;rdquo; version for quite a bit of money ($20/month minumum but up to $800/month) and also an open source edition, which is what OSE stands for.</description>

      <description>Oh what a tangled web we weave. I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what&amp;rsquo;s going on with this one or how I got here, I wanted to explore a search I had seen on Shodan called &amp;ldquo;3cx servers bcn&amp;rdquo; but now I&amp;rsquo;m trapped in a digital hall of mirrors. 3CX is a private telephone exchange that sometimes runs over VoIP, and has servers that typically tend to run on 5001.

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m staying with a friend whose partner has a pretty serious media server set up (with 64TB! of content), and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d take a look to see if I could find it on Shodan. And sure enough I could!
My Friend&amp;rsquo;s Media Server on 104.172.240.189 So I had previously seen a Plex service running on an IP back on day 9, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t investigate it too much because at the time I was focused on the irrigation system.</description>

      <description>In what I hope will become an infrequently regular feature I decided today to look for an already hacked server that had been defaced. I had found one in the process of defacement on my very first day, but the fully defaced ones are interesting largely because of the tags left by the hackers themselves. I&amp;rsquo;m a little nervous about drawing attention to myself by publishing hacker tags in plaintext (easily found via Google alerts) so I&amp;rsquo;ll mostly be doing that via images.</description>

      <guid>http://blog.alden.website/post/100days/Day-17/</guid>
      <description>Today I thought it might be fun to find an ATM, largely because I wanted to answer the question &amp;ldquo;why connect an ATM to the internet with a static IP?&amp;rdquo; I checked for past Shodan searches for ATMs to see if I could find anyone else looking for some so I would know what to look for, and I was able to find someone else looking for ATMs from a brand named NCR, which work over port 169.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m pretty busy today with Processing Day so I&amp;rsquo;ll keep today&amp;rsquo;s short. Shodan may be best known for finding strangers&amp;rsquo; webcams, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t gone for one yet because early on in this project I decided that on days when I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of time I&amp;rsquo;d just find an unsecured webcam and grab a still image. Today is one of those days.

      <description>Another IoT home device today. At this point I&amp;rsquo;m picturing the people with these things basically having a Wallace and Gromit style lifestyle (note: I do have a wifi plug and yes this is my lifestyle). This one was inspired by another search I didn&amp;rsquo;t recognize, for &amp;ldquo;Sonoff&amp;rdquo;.
A Sonoff wifi enabled plug on 87.20.184.148 Sonoff is a company that makes IoT plugs and switches, as well as a couple of models of IoT fans and light bulbs.</description>

      <description>This is another find inspired by recent searches on Shodan. I saw searches &amp;ldquo;FHEM Home Automation&amp;rdquo; and I needed to know more.
Fhem Home Automation Server on 85.190.248.171 Every single result for FHEM was from Germany. So I picked the first one and got going. Looking up FHEM first on Google I found that it is an open source server software for doing home automation, built in perl and meant to be run on any kind of full time 24 /7 computer, like a Raspberry Pi.</description>

      <description>In honor of my spending about six hours on an airplane today I decided to search Shodan for &amp;ldquo;satellite&amp;rdquo; and, giving myself over to fate, pick the first result without looking at it.
The Email Server of a Long Defunct Conference at 163.44.163.77 Since I was inspired by the fact that my airplane is being serviced by satellite internet I was of course hoping that I would find the IP for a real actual space satellite, though I suspected I was more likely to find someone&amp;rsquo;s satellite internet router or satellite dish.</description>

      <description>Today I saw a top search for something called &amp;ldquo;GraphQL&amp;rdquo;. Taking the bait on the unknown, I started looking.
A Startup Named Zipline&amp;rsquo;s API Staging Space on 184.169.231.191 The first thing I noticed about GraphQL&amp;rsquo;s distribution on Shodan was that it was all in the US. The second was that it was, by a huge margin, all in Ashburn, Virginia. After doing a quick google search I figured out that this is certainly because Amazon has so many datacenters there (leading it to be cheekily referred to as the &amp;ldquo;center of the internet&amp;rdquo;), and every GraphQL service seemed to be running on an Amazon EC2 instance.</description>

      <description>Today I went looking for MongoDB databases. I used MongoDB back in Shawn Van Every&amp;rsquo;s servers class, I remember feeling pretty cool using a NoSQL database. Shodan indicated that MongoDB tends to work off of port 27017 so that&amp;rsquo;s where I started looking.
The Shell of Someone&amp;rsquo;s Machine Learning Blog on 35.185.145.24 I picked one of the first results I found on Shodan. According to Shodan it&amp;rsquo;s located in Singapore and hosted on Google Cloud services.</description>

      <title>Shodan Stories Day 10: Reading License Plates in Louisiana, the Bygone Days of Java Webapps, and Spying on Cops</title>

      <description>I was feeling listless today and a bit grumpy, so I decided to look for something that I could be motivationally upset about: automatic license plate readers (ALPRs). These are a kind of surveillance camera that are frequently used by police forces or parking facility managers to track cars and car movement. You might have seen a kind of them attached to traffic signal beams to catch red light runners, but they are used far more widely than just that.</description>

      <title>Shodan Stories Day 9: I Got Rickrolled by an Irrigation System in Los Vegas</title>

      <description>This is another one I found from looking at recent searches on Shodan. Someone searched for &amp;ldquo;BlueSpray irrigation&amp;rdquo; and I decided to follow their lead.
BlueSpray Wifi-Enabled Irrigation Controller (or maybe somebody&amp;rsquo;s pentesting playground) on 71.52.48.61 BlueSpray is a startup that makes an internet of things irrigation system for the consumer level (so for suburban lawns, not farms). If &amp;ldquo;internet of things lawn sprinkler&amp;rdquo; makes your eyes roll all the way back into your head well then this blog is for you.</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago I noticed some people searching on Shodan for &amp;ldquo;ETH: total speed&amp;rdquo;. That didn&amp;rsquo;t mean anything to me so I took note of it and today decided to dig in.
An Ethereum Miner on 186.90.40.229 Almost all the results I found for this search in Shodan were running off of port 3001 (the ones that weren&amp;rsquo;t were on 9001), and tended to be in Russia, South Korea, or Ukraine.</description>

      <description>Someone tried to phish me yesterday via text from a Los Vegas phone number. Fortunately I was able to figure out their IP address and, yes, their IP is on Shodan. Someone Trying to Phish Me on 146.120.89.201 I started out checking both Ð½Ð¾Ð¼Ðµ.ÑÑ and xn&amp;ndash;e1ance.xn&amp;ndash;p1ai, which is the address the text message actually links to. In case you are wondering, and don&amp;rsquo;t want to read further, Ð½Ð¾Ð¼Ðµ.ÑÑ is safe to go to in a browser but xn&amp;ndash;e1ance.</description>

      <description>Today I decided to look for more industrial control systems, specifically Mitsubishi Q-Series logic controllers.
Yokohama Air Traffic Control Tower on 133.34.157.13 Reading about them on Shodan it looks like the Q-Series logic controllers tend to run off ports 5006 or 5007. So I did a search for those open ports. Judging from the results it looks like the majority of these Mitsubishi controllers are in Japan, not surprising I suppose since Mitsubishi is a Japanese company.</description>

      <description>Today I decided to go looking for MySQL databases. I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved SQL, it was one of the first &amp;ldquo;programming languages&amp;rdquo; I learned and was a big part of one of my first jobs.
Institute of Industrial Organic Chemistry on 79.96.39.102 Checking with MySQL documents I found that MySQL databases typically run off of port 3306. So I went on Shodan to look for things with port 3306. One of the first results I saw was from Poland, and being Polish I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist poking around a bit in the homeland.</description>

      <description>Today I saw that the fifth most searched for term on Shodan of the day was &amp;ldquo;dreambox&amp;rdquo;. What a name! I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist! After a little digging I found that dreambox probably referred to a kind of linux-based television receiver, made by a German company with a truly fantastic logo. Cloned Dreambox Television Receiver on 84.39.177.219 I started out just searching on Shodan for &amp;ldquo;dreambox&amp;rdquo;, like so many others were doing today.</description>

      <description>Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t do Minecraft servers yesterday I decided to do them today. First I read a little guide on how to set up a Minecraft server to get a sense of what they looked like.
Les Chevaliers Royale Minecraft Server on 97.94.56.211 I actually don&amp;rsquo;t know much about Minecraft, I&amp;rsquo;ve never played it. I know it&amp;rsquo;s popular with a wide range of people, and that really dedicated players like to set up servers for group play, so I thought it might be interesting to look around for a server and figure out if I could find the people who were using it.</description>

      <description>Today I had two quick ideas for what to look for, either industrial control systems or minecraft servers. Flipping a coin, ICS won out. Reading a quick Shodan guide on them I decided to look for Siemens control systems, for no reason other than I&amp;rsquo;d heard of them before.
Joann Fabric&amp;rsquo;s Industrial Control System on 208.83.32.213 Siemens has a proprietary network protocol called S7 Communications that they use for their Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), which they also provide a nice sales brochure for.</description>

      <description>A note up front:
Generally I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with an ethical question of this project, should I be publishing the IP addresses and personal identification of individual people I find? I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine that anyone reading this would take that info and do anything untoward with it, but it&amp;rsquo;s an odd stance on surveillance culture to dox strangers meaninglessly, even if the ability to reach out and randomly touching a stranger is the reality of networked existence.</description>
