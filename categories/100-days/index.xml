      <description>I saw someone&amp;rsquo;s search for &amp;ldquo;Synology DiskStation&amp;rdquo; and even given our little foray into Synology back on day 20 I was ready to dive back into the world of the globe&amp;rsquo;s premier network attached storage maker.
A Prototype of a Taiwanese Farm&amp;rsquo;s Website on 114.34.78.222 The DiskStation promises &amp;ldquo;personal cloud storage&amp;rdquo; which to me sounds just like a personal server you connect to the internet, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just old fashioned.</description>

      <title>Shodan Stories Day 21: POWERful Plates in Fargo, Digital Signage, Unsecured Pis, and the Cold Cold Midwest Winter</title>

      <description>Today I saw someone searching for &amp;ldquo;Screenly OSE&amp;rdquo; and actually gave a description for their search saying &amp;ldquo;screenly ose for the pi, think of a billboard system&amp;rdquo;. So I gave it a go.
A Raspberry Pi Digital Sign on 140.186.23.181 Screenly is a software for doing digital signage off of a Raspberry Pi. They have a &amp;ldquo;Pro&amp;rdquo; version for quite a bit of money ($20/month minumum but up to $800/month) and also an open source edition, which is what OSE stands for.</description>

      <description>Oh what a tangled web we weave. I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what&amp;rsquo;s going on with this one or how I got here, I wanted to explore a search I had seen on Shodan called &amp;ldquo;3cx servers bcn&amp;rdquo; but now I&amp;rsquo;m trapped in a digital hall of mirrors. 3CX is a private telephone exchange that sometimes runs over VoIP, and has servers that typically tend to run on 5001.

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m staying with a friend whose partner has a pretty serious media server set up (with 64TB! of content), and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d take a look to see if I could find it on Shodan. And sure enough I could!
My Friend&amp;rsquo;s Media Server on 104.172.240.189 So I had previously seen a Plex service running on an IP back on day 9, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t investigate it too much because at the time I was focused on the irrigation system.</description>

      <title>Shodan Stories Day 18: Defaced Server in Walnut, Hacking in a Nutshell, These Jokes Don&#39;t Write Themselves!</title>

      <description>In what I hope will become an infrequently regular feature I decided today to look for an already hacked server that had been defaced. I had found one in the process of defacement on my very first day, but the fully defaced ones are interesting largely because of the tags left by the hackers themselves. I&amp;rsquo;m a little nervous about drawing attention to myself by publishing hacker tags in plaintext (easily found via Google alerts) so I&amp;rsquo;ll mostly be doing that via images.</description>

      <title>Shodan Stories Day 17: An ATM in Perm, Russia and Just How Much Market Capture Does Windows 2000 Have Anyway?</title>

      <description>Today I thought it might be fun to find an ATM, largely because I wanted to answer the question &amp;ldquo;why connect an ATM to the internet with a static IP?&amp;rdquo; I checked for past Shodan searches for ATMs to see if I could find anyone else looking for some so I would know what to look for, and I was able to find someone else looking for ATMs from a brand named NCR, which work over port 169.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m pretty busy today with Processing Day so I&amp;rsquo;ll keep today&amp;rsquo;s short. Shodan may be best known for finding strangers&amp;rsquo; webcams, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t gone for one yet because early on in this project I decided that on days when I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of time I&amp;rsquo;d just find an unsecured webcam and grab a still image. Today is one of those days.

      <description>Another IoT home device today. At this point I&amp;rsquo;m picturing the people with these things basically having a Wallace and Gromit style lifestyle (note: I do have a wifi plug and yes this is my lifestyle). This one was inspired by another search I didn&amp;rsquo;t recognize, for &amp;ldquo;Sonoff&amp;rdquo;.
A Sonoff wifi enabled plug on 87.20.184.148 Sonoff is a company that makes IoT plugs and switches, as well as a couple of models of IoT fans and light bulbs.</description>

      <title>Shodan Stories Day 14: Startling Strangers in Vreden, DIY Home Automation, and the German Word for Waking Up in the Middle of the Night with the Realization That You Left Your Server Unsecured</title>

      <description>This is another find inspired by recent searches on Shodan. I saw searches &amp;ldquo;FHEM Home Automation&amp;rdquo; and I needed to know more.
Fhem Home Automation Server on 85.190.248.171 Every single result for FHEM was from Germany. So I picked the first one and got going. Looking up FHEM first on Google I found that it is an open source server software for doing home automation, built in perl and meant to be run on any kind of full time 24 /7 computer, like a Raspberry Pi.</description>

      <description>In honor of my spending about six hours on an airplane today I decided to search Shodan for &amp;ldquo;satellite&amp;rdquo; and, giving myself over to fate, pick the first result without looking at it.
The Email Server of a Long Defunct Conference at 163.44.163.77 Since I was inspired by the fact that my airplane is being serviced by satellite internet I was of course hoping that I would find the IP for a real actual space satellite, though I suspected I was more likely to find someone&amp;rsquo;s satellite internet router or satellite dish.</description>

      <title>Shodan Stories Day 12: Influencer to Brand Marketplace and Authentic Content Platform in St Louis, Damaging My Klout Score via Unauthorized API Calls, GraphQL IDEs, and the Center of the Internet</title>

      <guid>http://blog.alden.website/post/100days/Day-12/</guid>
      <description>Today I saw a top search for something called &amp;ldquo;GraphQL&amp;rdquo;. Taking the bait on the unknown, I started looking.
A Startup Named Zipline&amp;rsquo;s API Staging Space on 184.169.231.191 The first thing I noticed about GraphQL&amp;rsquo;s distribution on Shodan was that it was all in the US. The second was that it was, by a huge margin, all in Ashburn, Virginia. After doing a quick google search I figured out that this is certainly because Amazon has so many datacenters there (leading it to be cheekily referred to as the &amp;ldquo;center of the internet&amp;rdquo;), and every GraphQL service seemed to be running on an Amazon EC2 instance.</description>

      <description>Today I went looking for MongoDB databases. I used MongoDB back in Shawn Van Every&amp;rsquo;s servers class, I remember feeling pretty cool using a NoSQL database. Shodan indicated that MongoDB tends to work off of port 27017 so that&amp;rsquo;s where I started looking.
The Shell of Someone&amp;rsquo;s Machine Learning Blog on 35.185.145.24 I picked one of the first results I found on Shodan. According to Shodan it&amp;rsquo;s located in Singapore and hosted on Google Cloud services.</description>

      <title>Shodan Stories Day 10: Reading License Plates in Louisiana, the Bygone Days of Java Webapps, and Spying on Cops</title>

      <description>I was feeling listless today and a bit grumpy, so I decided to look for something that I could be motivationally upset about: automatic license plate readers (ALPRs). These are a kind of surveillance camera that are frequently used by police forces or parking facility managers to track cars and car movement. You might have seen a kind of them attached to traffic signal beams to catch red light runners, but they are used far more widely than just that.</description>

      <title>Shodan Stories Day 9: I Got Rickrolled by an Irrigation System in Los Vegas</title>

      <description>This is another one I found from looking at recent searches on Shodan. Someone searched for &amp;ldquo;BlueSpray irrigation&amp;rdquo; and I decided to follow their lead.
BlueSpray Wifi-Enabled Irrigation Controller (or maybe somebody&amp;rsquo;s pentesting playground) on 71.52.48.61 BlueSpray is a startup that makes an internet of things irrigation system for the consumer level (so for suburban lawns, not farms). If &amp;ldquo;internet of things lawn sprinkler&amp;rdquo; makes your eyes roll all the way back into your head well then this blog is for you.</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago I noticed some people searching on Shodan for &amp;ldquo;ETH: total speed&amp;rdquo;. That didn&amp;rsquo;t mean anything to me so I took note of it and today decided to dig in.
An Ethereum Miner on 186.90.40.229 Almost all the results I found for this search in Shodan were running off of port 3001 (the ones that weren&amp;rsquo;t were on 9001), and tended to be in Russia, South Korea, or Ukraine.</description>

      <description>Someone tried to phish me yesterday via text from a Los Vegas phone number. Fortunately I was able to figure out their IP address and, yes, their IP is on Shodan. Someone Trying to Phish Me on 146.120.89.201 I started out checking both номе.рф and xn&amp;ndash;e1ance.xn&amp;ndash;p1ai, which is the address the text message actually links to. In case you are wondering, and don&amp;rsquo;t want to read further, номе.рф is safe to go to in a browser but xn&amp;ndash;e1ance.</description>

      <description>Today I decided to look for more industrial control systems, specifically Mitsubishi Q-Series logic controllers.
Yokohama Air Traffic Control Tower on 133.34.157.13 Reading about them on Shodan it looks like the Q-Series logic controllers tend to run off ports 5006 or 5007. So I did a search for those open ports. Judging from the results it looks like the majority of these Mitsubishi controllers are in Japan, not surprising I suppose since Mitsubishi is a Japanese company.</description>

      <description>Today I decided to go looking for MySQL databases. I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved SQL, it was one of the first &amp;ldquo;programming languages&amp;rdquo; I learned and was a big part of one of my first jobs.
Institute of Industrial Organic Chemistry on 79.96.39.102 Checking with MySQL documents I found that MySQL databases typically run off of port 3306. So I went on Shodan to look for things with port 3306. One of the first results I saw was from Poland, and being Polish I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist poking around a bit in the homeland.</description>

      <description>Today I saw that the fifth most searched for term on Shodan of the day was &amp;ldquo;dreambox&amp;rdquo;. What a name! I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist! After a little digging I found that dreambox probably referred to a kind of linux-based television receiver, made by a German company with a truly fantastic logo. Cloned Dreambox Television Receiver on 84.39.177.219 I started out just searching on Shodan for &amp;ldquo;dreambox&amp;rdquo;, like so many others were doing today.</description>

      <description>Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t do Minecraft servers yesterday I decided to do them today. First I read a little guide on how to set up a Minecraft server to get a sense of what they looked like.
Les Chevaliers Royale Minecraft Server on 97.94.56.211 I actually don&amp;rsquo;t know much about Minecraft, I&amp;rsquo;ve never played it. I know it&amp;rsquo;s popular with a wide range of people, and that really dedicated players like to set up servers for group play, so I thought it might be interesting to look around for a server and figure out if I could find the people who were using it.</description>

      <description>Today I had two quick ideas for what to look for, either industrial control systems or minecraft servers. Flipping a coin, ICS won out. Reading a quick Shodan guide on them I decided to look for Siemens control systems, for no reason other than I&amp;rsquo;d heard of them before.
Joann Fabric&amp;rsquo;s Industrial Control System on 208.83.32.213 Siemens has a proprietary network protocol called S7 Communications that they use for their Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), which they also provide a nice sales brochure for.</description>

      <description>A note up front:
Generally I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with an ethical question of this project, should I be publishing the IP addresses and personal identification of individual people I find? I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine that anyone reading this would take that info and do anything untoward with it, but it&amp;rsquo;s an odd stance on surveillance culture to dox strangers meaninglessly, even if the ability to reach out and randomly touching a stranger is the reality of networked existence.</description>
