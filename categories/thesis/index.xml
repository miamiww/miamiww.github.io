      <description>This past weekend I was speaking at the Schemers, Scammers, and Subverters Symposium in Portland, OR, and I asked the organizers if I could also run a prototype of my thesis at the event. Obviously I didn&amp;rsquo;t describe it as such to them, in keeping with the spirit of the event I said that I had a fully polished performance ready named &amp;ldquo;Future&amp;rsquo;s Market&amp;rdquo;. As part of the conference they were also running a market called &amp;ldquo;The Totally Honest Barter Bazaar&amp;rdquo;, and they told me I could take up a little corner of the room in order to hawk my wares.</description>
