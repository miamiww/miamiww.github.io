      <description>When thinking of making my own poetic form I, in a fit of grandiose mania, decided that I would make my own form of generative epic poetry. Dactylic hexameter?&amp;hellip; yes! Alliteration?&amp;hellip; YES! Epithets?&amp;hellip; YES YES!! Heroic narrative defining the moral values of my society?&amp;hellip; YES YES YES!!!
Well it didn&amp;rsquo;t really work out that well. The biggest problem is that narrative is really hard to pull off with generative and random-based methods.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with my iMessage history in order to do a sentiment analysis over time. In doing so I decided to start trying to randomly generate new texts that would kind of sound like me, much like the kind of creepy post-death chatbot made by training a neural net on all of your messages. My results weren&amp;rsquo;t that&amp;hellip; good, but there was enough structure there to hint at real language.</description>
