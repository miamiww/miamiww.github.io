      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been wanting to recreate the experience of playing with confetti, this is one prototype for interacting with confetti by &amp;#8220;blowing&amp;#8221; on it with the mouse.

Right now they kind of jiggle around expectantly, this was to meet the &amp;#8220;one element that moves independently of the mouse&amp;#8221; part of the homework.Â Getting the confetti to move realistically when blown has been a pain, right now it jumps around semi-randomly, which gives a good imitation of a scattering effect but the motion is discontinuous and unnatural.</description>
