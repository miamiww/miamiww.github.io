      <description>Here you can see the slides from my research presentation
Reports, Research Papers, and Press Releases As a great resource for all of our classes&amp;rsquo; discussions on AI I want to point out first the AI Now annual report. AI Now Institute is a research institute (within NYU! we can go talk to them) focused on interdisciplinary research on the social impacts of AI.
Journalism, Think-pieces, and Analysis Right now a big cluttered list * Shannon Mattern arguing against computational thinking in urban space, the piece that started me thinking about this topic * Wired goes deep on China&amp;rsquo;s social credit score * Propublica&amp;rsquo;s fantastic reporting series on machine bias lead by Julia Angwin and Lauren Kirchner * The New Yorker on New York City&amp;rsquo;s recent algorithmic transparency law * Electronic Frontier Foundation&amp;rsquo;s report on facial recognition in policing * The Atlantic on Alphabet&amp;rsquo;s growing role in Toronto * Data and Society&amp;rsquo;s Rebecca Wexler on automation in criminal justice * The Verge breaking Palantir&amp;rsquo;s secret contract with New Orleans * The technology trade journal Spectrum IEEE on predicting neighborhood income with Google street view data * ITP&amp;rsquo;s own Mimi Onuoha on systems of algorithmic violence * The Economists&amp;rsquo;s cautious endoresment of government use of machine learning * The Wire on Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s contracts with Andhra Pradesh</description>
