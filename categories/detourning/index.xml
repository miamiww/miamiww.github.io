      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t like working over long breaks because - well - instead of making one finished project I have three projects that are halfway done. The first is the most complete but also the simplest, with Cambridge Analytica so in the news I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist doing something with one of my all time favorite videos, their talk at the Concordia Summit in 2016. I&amp;rsquo;m surprised it took so long for their story to break.</description>
