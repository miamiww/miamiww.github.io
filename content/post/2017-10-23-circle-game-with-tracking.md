I overhauled some of the code from [my project last week](http://www.alden.life/2017/10/16/circle-game/) so that events would only happen once so that the player would not experience an event more than once.Â  I&#8217;d like to implement some further tracking so that the narrative would change depending on what the user had done previously but I didn&#8217;t finish that in a playable way.

You can see the improved code [here](https://github.com/miamiww/ComputationalMedia/blob/master/Week6/circleGameTracking.js).

I put a playable version of it [here](https://alpha.editor.p5js.org/full/SJwwM0jTW).
