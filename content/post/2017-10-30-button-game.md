I&#8217;m in the middle of changing hosts for my blog so I will keep this entry short. I made a game involving clicking DOM buttons&#8230; a lot.

You can see the code for the game [here](https://github.com/miamiww/ComputationalMedia/blob/master/Week7/domHwSketch.js).

And you can play the game [here](http://104.131.3.199:7000/index.html).
