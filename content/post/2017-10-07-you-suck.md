Katya and I started out just sitting next to each other, noodling around and sharing what we were doing. I ended up making this moon pattern with a surprise:

[<img class="alignnone wp-image-223 size-full" src="http://www.alden.life/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dotMoons.png" alt="" width="614" height="610" srcset="http://www.alden.life/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dotMoons.png 614w, http://www.alden.life/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dotMoons-150x150.png 150w, http://www.alden.life/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dotMoons-300x298.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" />](https://alpha.editor.p5js.org/full/BJ8hJ_L3Z)

You can see the code for that [here](https://alpha.editor.p5js.org/alden/sketches/BJ8hJ_L3Z).

Katya then had the idea to make something that prompted the user to write something on the screen but then whatever they tried to write it would just spell out &#8220;You Suck&#8221;. I thought that was pretty funny but we weren&#8217;t sure how to get the actual drawing mechanism to work, i.e. how to make it look like what was being printed onto the screen was happening in real time but only when the user clicked and moved. We started doing research and thinking about stuff and eventually we came up with this, click-through for interactivity:
