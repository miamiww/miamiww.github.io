title: Peñabots, Digital Obfuscation, and Government Trolling

In the first class I mentioned peñabots as an example of government social media manipulation. Rather than define them myself I&#8217;ll lean on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe%C3%B1abot) definition: &#8220;the name given to what analysts believe to be a network of automated accounts on social media used by the Mexican government to spread pro-government propaganda and to marginalize dissenting opinions in social media&#8221;. Though not the first institutionally-organized trolling operation they stand apart for their sophistication, their effectiveness at shutting down oppositional organizing, and their use in a nominally non-authoritarian government (although one with a deep history of media manipulation).



A lot of research has already been done on peñabots so I will just point to a few good places to get started. I first heard about them in Finn Burton and Helen Nissenbaum&#8217;s great book [Obfuscation](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/obfuscation), which is a great research jumping off point for a whole host of different kinds of obfuscatory digital practices. The above talk from Chaos Communications Camp in 2015 is a great expose of original research. If watching something doesn&#8217;t feel right, Erin Gallagher has collected a trove of news and research articles collected on in a [Medium page](https://medium.com/@erin_gallagher/news-articles-about-bots-trolls-in-mexican-networks-7b1e551ef4a6). If you only want to read one article, you could check out [this one](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/z4maww/how-mexican-twitter-bots-shut-down-dissent) from Motherboard. Or if you are more into podcasts you could listen to [this Reply All episode](https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all/112-the-prophet).

Now, for Americans in 2018, peñabots probably call to mind Russian government-sponsored trolling. For a really good early treatment on the Russian Internet Research Agency and their social media manipulation campaigns I would direct you to Adrien Chen&#8217;s [piece for the New York Times Magazine.](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html)
