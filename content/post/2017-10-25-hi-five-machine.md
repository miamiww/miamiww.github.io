For our midterm Ridwan and I thought it would be really funny to make a machine that claims to give a high five but actually fakes you out every time.



Aesthetically it reminds me a bit of the [toilet hand](http://www.goombastomp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/zlCfzTDIfO8jrA4bnw.jpg) from Zelda.

Inside it has an arduino, two metal gear servos on a pan/tilt bracket meant for camera tracking controlling the hand, an HC- SR04 distance sensor, and an LCD screen. Ridwan found a box template for a laser cutter and we laser cut the enclosure out of cardboard, making the necessary modifications for our sensor, hand, and screen.

We had quite a bit of trouble with powering servos and actually destroyed two servos by putting too high a voltage across them.
