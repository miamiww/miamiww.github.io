I wanted to make a game-as-interactive-poetry without clear goals but with player progress still mediated by &#8220;points&#8221;.



&#8220;Points&#8221; are displayed constantly in the upper left corner. Doing nothing makes the points go down, clicking and holding the circle in the center makes the points go up. I was thinking of &#8220;cookie clicker&#8221; type games (like the currently buzzing [paper clip AI game)](https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/10/11/16457742/ai-paperclips-thought-experiment-game-frank-lantz) when I made this and how much I hate them for creating unintersting artificial rewards that my brain still loves.



Code is on my github [here](https://github.com/miamiww/ComputationalMedia/blob/master/Week5/circlegame.js).
