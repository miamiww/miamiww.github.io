I wanted to make a game-as-interactive-poetry without clear goals but with player progress still mediated by &#8220;points&#8221;.



&#8220;Points&#8221; are displayed constantly in the upper left corner. Doing nothing makes the points go down, clicking and holding the circle in the center makes the points go up. I was thinking of &#8220;cookie clicker&#8221; type games (like the currently buzzing [paper clip AI game)][1] when I made this and how much I hate them for creating unintersting artificial rewards that my brain still loves.



Code is on my github [here][2].
