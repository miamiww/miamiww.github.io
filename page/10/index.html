						&ldquo;In the end everything&rsquo;s garbage&rdquo; - Nick DiMola (one of my experts)
&ldquo;Trash carries dystopia within&rdquo; - Maite Zubiaurre
Heaven Is A Waste Place is a simulated corporation, The Ongoing Now Corporation, and the space in which it is simulated. It is part office role play and part doomsday cult. The goal of TONCO and its employees is to find new uses for waste after the apocalypse, and maybe a new, more holy way of life.&hellip;

						Inspired in part by seasteaders and other such cults which are entirely engaged in a utopia-building project even if that utopia looks like a nightmare to outsiders, I&rsquo;ve begun building my own mythology of The Ongoing Now Corporation.
TON Corp is a corporate cult created by Theong Oingnow for the purpose of preparing for the Bow Sink, the day that Noah&rsquo;s ark finally capsizes.
Preparations include the collection, analysis, and categorization of various discarded objects.&hellip;

						Beverly and I decided to work on a quick VJing system. We started out doing research and interviewed a few people on the floor to ask them what they thought made for good VJing, and what made for bad VJing. The most consistent thing we heard was that the visuals should match the mood and timing of the music. Since beat syncing the visuals to the music might be hard with REST we decided to have two &ldquo;modes&rdquo; for the system, GIF mode and visuals mode.&hellip;

						My network map was more or less what I expected to see. Here&rsquo;s the map from Herbivore. Note that my public IP&rsquo;s threat level is low.
The TP-Link at 192.168.0.1 is, naturally, my router. The TP-Link at .100 is actually my wifi-enabled plug from the same manufacturer. The Amazon Technologies device is an Echo (running 64 bit Linux? I thought they ran &lsquo;Amazon Fire&rsquo; EDIT: looks like Fire OS has a Linux kernel), The Canon is a printer, the Pis are actually a single Pi connected via both wifi and ethernet.&hellip;

						Does garbage conceal our dreams for the future? Is &lsquo;throwing out&rsquo; a hopeful act?  Do we remake ourselves with each discard? The Life Changing Magic of Throwing Out? What is &ldquo;trash&rdquo; culture? Junk food? Jerry Springer? Garbage / the lesser than.
A cockroach literally, actually crawled across my monitor just now. Cleansing and purging. Removal.&hellip;

						A show based on my own biography? It&rsquo;s almost too much to ask, my brain feels like it&rsquo;s turning over trying to keep up with the flood of associations. There&rsquo;s me as a young dancer, watching William Forsythe&rsquo;s Improvisation Technologies, or working with Physical Education, or reading The Collected Stories of Lydia Davis. Going to Berghain with my sister and then reading Gender Trouble all the next day without sleeping. There&rsquo;s me as a young gallerist flying to New York to see the Wynn Greenwood show that such and such person had curated with the New Museum.&hellip;

						In making this project I had on my mind both the kind of joy of speaking to non-humans and feeling understood, generating a level of closeness that can feel deep yet uncomplicated, and the kind of snake-oilish claims that some researchers in the AI community make about their work. Naturally these thoughts led me to start making a device that would allow users to speak directly with their plants and have the plants speak back.&hellip;

						You can play Cybercaves 2: Return 2 Cybercave here. Setting out on making my original Twine game I had just wanted to play around and have a laugh, working with typical choose your own, cyberpunk, and text adventure genre conventions like so many Lego blocks. I also had two games on my mind: Porpetine&rsquo;s drown in 2 inches of humid bathbomb water, a game much more serious than mine but that uses Twine to ambigously shift between genres, and Frog Fractions, which I think of frequently as an apotheosis of a kind of cultural overflow, of media objects so steeped in referential circulationism that the joke becomes their own lack of essence.&hellip;
