        <div class="content">
          For our midterm Ridwan and I thought it would be really funny to make a machine that claims to give a high five but actually fakes you out every time.
Aesthetically it reminds me a bit of the toilet hand from Zelda.
Inside it has an arduino, two metal gear servos on a pan/tilt bracket meant for camera tracking controlling the hand, an HC- SR04 distance sensor, and an LCD screen.

          &nbsp;
I overhauled some of the code from my project last week so that events would only happen once so that the player would not experience an event more than once.Â I&#8217;d like to implement some further tracking so that the narrative would change depending on what the user had done previously but I didn&#8217;t finish that in a playable way.
You can see the improved code here.
I put a playable version of it here.

          Side A of the business card:
I really liked the hands and eyes that I had going in my show poster, so I decided that I wanted the same kind of thing for my business card. I wasn&#8217;t really sure what to put for my &#8220;title&#8221; so that is just a placeholder for now. The font I used was &#8220;Gil Sans&#8221; and I took my Twitter and Github icons from their media packages.

          (note all the code for these projects can be viewed on my Github here though I will make specific references to scripts down below).
One of my P5 projects that I am the happiest with is an interactive poetry/anti-game game that involves corralling a ball with the cursor to reveal a narrative. I decided I wanted to replace the mouse and cursor with a joystick, and that I wanted to use node, express, and a websocket to interface between P5 and the arduino.

        <div class="content">
          I wanted to make a game-as-interactive-poetry without clear goals but with player progress still mediated by &#8220;points&#8221;.
&#8220;Points&#8221; are displayed constantly in the upper left corner. Doing nothing makes the points go down, clicking and holding the circle in the center makes the points go up. I was thinking of &#8220;cookie clicker&#8221; type games (like the currently buzzing paper clip AI game) when I made this and how much I hate them for creating unintersting artificial rewards that my brain still loves.

          Initially I wanted to make something inspired by Tadanori Yokoo. I spent a lot of time futzing around with different elements but I ultimately decided what I liked was the simplest, a little line drawing reaching out to the show information, giving a sense of playfulness. I really like this color contrast but I think it might be a little distracting. I put a less contrast version on the bottom of the post.

          Katya and I started out just sitting next to each other, noodling around and sharing what we were doing. I ended up making this moon pattern with a surprise:

You can see the code for that here.
Katya then had the idea to make something that prompted the user to write something on the screen but then whatever they tried to write it would just spell out &#8220;You Suck&#8221;. I thought that was pretty funny but we weren&#8217;t sure how to get the actual drawing mechanism to work, i.

        <div class="content">
          I wanted to make a project that would display a dubiously motivational message each time I sat at my home office desk. To start off I used a HC-SR04 ping distance sensor and attached a pin with a message (in this case a pin I got at the art book fair) to a little SG90 micro servo motor. I initially tried to map the distance readings of the HC-SR04 to the angle of the servo motor, but it was too noisy and the servo jittered around quickly (you can see that code commented out below).

I took my color palette from my twitter avi (drawn by Norah Horwitz). From there I created several pattern using P5.js inspired by 90s design, current brutalist web design, and art deco. You can see the code here.
