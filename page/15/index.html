					<time>Oct 4, 2017</time>
					<br><div class="description">
						
						I wanted to make a project that would display a dubiously motivational message each time I sat at my home office desk. To start off I used a HC-SR04 ping distance sensor and attached a pin with a message (in this case a pin I got at the art book fair) to a little SG90 micro servo motor. I initially tried to map the distance readings of the HC-SR04 to the angle of the servo motor, but it was too noisy and the servo jittered around quickly (you can see that code commented out below).&hellip;

I took my color palette from my twitter avi (drawn by Norah Horwitz). From there I created several pattern using P5.js inspired by 90s design, current brutalist web design, and art deco. You can see the code here.

						Initial Ideas
As you can see from the above picture Amitabh, Martin, and I had a few different ideas, but we settled on a device that takes the way in which online human communications are mediated via AI algorithms and replicates it in the real world. We debated for a while what form we wanted this to take &#8211; either a consumer level device for facial recognition for emotion or an AI that determines political leanings.&hellip;

						On first glance of a boarding pass I notice not just a jumble of information poorly organized, but too much information, a heaping mass of which obscures the information that the traveller is really am interested in when they have a pass in hand.
The date is unnecessary, a traveler would only be receiving this pass on the day of the flight. Origin and destinations are also unnecessary; we must assume that they have knowledge of their destination and current locations already in mind.&hellip;

						Since moving to New York I&#8217;ve done it again and again: swiped my MetroCard through the reader only to slam at full walking speed into an unmoving turnstile. At first I thought the problem was just me, I was new to the subway and hadn&#8217;t gotten the hang of swiping smoothly enough to avoid &#8220;PLEASE SWIPE AGAIN&#8221;, but then I noticed that I was not alone in my turnstile mistakes. Not only were other people getting the &#8220;PLEASE SWIPE AGAIN&#8221; message, they were walking straight into the turnstile after doing it.&hellip;

					<time>Sep 25, 2017</time>
					<br><div class="description">
						
						I&#8217;ve been wanting to recreate the experience of playing with confetti, this is one prototype for interacting with confetti by &#8220;blowing&#8221; on it with the mouse.

Right now they kind of jiggle around expectantly, this was to meet the &#8220;one element that moves independently of the mouse&#8221; part of the homework. Getting the confetti to move realistically when blown has been a pain, right now it jumps around semi-randomly, which gives a good imitation of a scattering effect but the motion is discontinuous and unnatural.&hellip;

						Pen Switch
My first switch was very simple, I wanted to incorporate elements outside of the traditional breadboard circuit so I used the metal part of a pen to connect two circuit elements and complete a circuit and light up an LED. 
Servo Switch
I really wanted to get my hands into programming the arduino so I next made a switch that involves stringing a resistor into the arm of a small servo motor and using the arduino to control the movements of the motor so that it completes a circuit and lights up an LED.&hellip;

						I started out my sign research scouting by going to the Rob Rauschenberg show at MoMA. Rauschenberg makes copious use of street signage, here are a couple of examples:
Decontextualizing signs makes them jarring, bringing them much more to the forefront of our consciousness than they occupy in their usual streetside homes.
(*\* if you are reading this it means that my webhost is terrible and will not let me upload a picture of Hans Deli&#8217;s sign I took &#8211; what I have to say about it is that it is simple, effective, and purposeful **)&hellip;

						I started off by trying to make faces/icons in the style of the Netflix user icons.

Quickly I got bored with that so then I started trying to make patterns with simple shapes that could be optical illusions or tiled as a desktop background&#8230; or a website background 🙂 I used for loops to avoid copy/pasting all my code:
