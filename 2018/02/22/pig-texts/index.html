        <p>I&rsquo;ve been working with my iMessage history in order to do a sentiment analysis over time. In doing so I decided to start trying to randomly generate new texts that would kind of sound like me, much like the kind of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/luka-artificial-intelligence-memorial-roman-mazurenko-bot">creepy post-death chatbot</a> made by training a neural net on all of your messages. My results weren&rsquo;t that&hellip; good, but there was enough structure there to hint at real language. It reminded me of this essay(poem?) written by Liam Gillick called <a href="http://supercommunity.e-flux.com/texts/weapons-grade-pig-work/">&ldquo;Weapons Grade Pig Work&rdquo;</a>, which creates a new kind of language reminiscent of both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_jargon">corporate-speak</a> and <a href="https://www.canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/international_art_english">International Art English</a>. So I mixed them all together to make art-corporate-alden jargon. I wouldn&rsquo;t call it a success.</p>
