<p>After that I tried running it as an if/then statement, where the servo would change positions if the distance sensor recorded a short distance. However, the servo didn’t change position even as I watched the distance go below the threshold on the serial monitor. Instead it stayed in one place making a really awful noise and getting hotter until it stopped moving at all. After that it wouldn’t move at all even for simpler movements like the servo sweep example code, leading me to think that it was broken. However I tried it again after it had cooled down and it worked fine, but just still not for the application I wanted.</p>
