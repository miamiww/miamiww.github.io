I overhauled some of the code from my project last week so that events would only happen once so that the player would not experience an event more than once. I&#8217;d like to implement some further tracking so that the narrative would change depending on what the user had done previously but I didn&#8217;t finish that in a playable way.
You can see the improved code here.
I put a playable version of it here." />
