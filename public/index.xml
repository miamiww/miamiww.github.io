      <description>For our midterm Ridwan and I thought it would be really funny to make a machine that claims to give a high five but actually fakes you out every time.
Aesthetically it reminds me a bit of the toilet hand from Zelda.
Inside it has an arduino, two metal gear servos on a pan/tilt bracket meant for camera tracking controlling the hand, an HC- SR04 distance sensor, and an LCD screen.</description>

      <title>Circle Game with Tracking</title>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;
I overhauled some of the code from my project last week so that events would only happen once so that the player would not experience an event more than once.Â I&amp;#8217;d like to implement some further tracking so that the narrative would change depending on what the user had done previously but I didn&amp;#8217;t finish that in a playable way.
You can see the improved code here.
I put a playable version of it here.</description>

      <title>Making a Controller for My P5 Game</title>

      <description>(note all the code for these projects can be viewed on my Github here though I will make specific references to scripts down below).
One of my P5 projects that I am the happiest with is an interactive poetry/anti-game game that involves corralling a ball with the cursor to reveal a narrative. I decided I wanted to replace the mouse and cursor with a joystick, and that I wanted to use node, express, and a websocket to interface between P5 and the arduino.</description>

      <description>Side A of the business card:
I really liked the hands and eyes that I had going in my show poster, so I decided that I wanted the same kind of thing for my business card. I wasn&amp;#8217;t really sure what to put for my &amp;#8220;title&amp;#8221; so that is just a placeholder for now. The font I used was &amp;#8220;Gil Sans&amp;#8221; and I took my Twitter and Github icons from their media packages.</description>

      <description>I wanted to make a game-as-interactive-poetry without clear goals but with player progress still mediated by &amp;#8220;points&amp;#8221;.
&amp;#8220;Points&amp;#8221; are displayed constantly in the upper left corner. Doing nothing makes the points go down, clicking and holding the circle in the center makes the points go up. I was thinking of &amp;#8220;cookie clicker&amp;#8221; type games (like the currently buzzing paper clip AI game) when I made this and how much I hate them for creating unintersting artificial rewards that my brain still loves.</description>

      <description>Initially I wanted to make something inspired by Tadanori Yokoo. I spent a lot of time futzing around with different elements but I ultimately decided what I liked was the simplest, a little line drawing reaching out to the show information, giving a sense of playfulness. I really like this color contrast but I think it might be a little distracting. I put a less contrast version on the bottom of the post.</description>

      <description>Katya and I started out just sitting next to each other, noodling around and sharing what we were doing. I ended up making this moon pattern with a surprise:

You can see the code for that here.
Katya then had the idea to make something that prompted the user to write something on the screen but then whatever they tried to write it would just spell out &amp;#8220;You Suck&amp;#8221;. I thought that was pretty funny but we weren&amp;#8217;t sure how to get the actual drawing mechanism to work, i.</description>

      <title>Breaking A Servo?</title>

      <guid>http://example.org/2017/10/04/breaking-a-servo/</guid>
      <description>I wanted to make a project that would display a dubiously motivational message each time I sat at my home office desk. To start off I used a HC-SR04 ping distance sensor and attached a pin with a message (in this case a pin I got at the art book fair) to a little SG90 micro servo motor. I initially tried to map the distance readings of the HC-SR04 to the angle of the servo motor, but it was too noisy and the servo jittered around quickly (you can see that code commented out below).</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;
I took my color palette from my twitter avi (drawn by Norah Horwitz). From there I created several pattern using P5.js inspired by 90s design, current brutalist web design, and art deco. You can see the code here.

      <description>Initial Ideas
As you can see from the above picture Amitabh, Martin, and I had a few different ideas, but we settled on a device that takes the way in which online human communications are mediated via AI algorithms and replicates it in the real world. We debated for a while what form we wanted this to take &amp;#8211; either a consumer level device for facial recognition for emotion or an AI that determines political leanings.</description>

      <description>Since moving to New York I&amp;#8217;ve done it again and again: swiped my MetroCard through the reader only to slam at full walking speed into an unmoving turnstile. At first I thought the problem was just me, I was new to the subway and hadn&amp;#8217;t gotten the hang of swiping smoothly enough to avoid &amp;#8220;PLEASE SWIPE AGAIN&amp;#8221;, but then I noticed that I was not alone in my turnstile mistakes. Not only were other people getting the &amp;#8220;PLEASE SWIPE AGAIN&amp;#8221; message, they were walking straight into the turnstile after doing it.</description>

      <title>Boarding Pass and Expressive Words</title>

      <description>On first glance of a boarding pass I notice not just a jumble of information poorly organized, but too much information, a heaping mass of which obscures the information that the traveller is really am interested in when they have a pass in hand.
The date is unnecessary, a traveler would only be receiving this pass on the day of the flight. Origin and destinations are also unnecessary; we must assume that they have knowledge of their destination and current locations already in mind.</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/2017/09/25/blowing-on-confetti/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been wanting to recreate the experience of playing with confetti, this is one prototype for interacting with confetti by &amp;#8220;blowing&amp;#8221; on it with the mouse.

Right now they kind of jiggle around expectantly, this was to meet the &amp;#8220;one element that moves independently of the mouse&amp;#8221; part of the homework.Â Getting the confetti to move realistically when blown has been a pain, right now it jumps around semi-randomly, which gives a good imitation of a scattering effect but the motion is discontinuous and unnatural.</description>

      <description>Pen Switch
My first switch was very simple,Â I wanted to incorporate elements outside of the traditional breadboard circuit soÂ I used the metal part of a pen to connect two circuit elements and complete a circuit and light up an LED.Â 
Servo Switch
I really wanted to get my hands into programming the arduino so I next made a switch that involves stringing a resistor into the arm of a small servo motor and using the arduino to control the movements of the motor so that it completes a circuit and lights up an LED.</description>

      <description>I started out my sign research scouting by going to the Rob Rauschenberg show at MoMA. Rauschenberg makes copious use of street signage, here are a couple of examples:
Decontextualizing signs makes them jarring, bringing them much more to the forefront of our consciousness than they occupy in their usual streetside homes.
(*\* if you are reading this it means that my webhost is terrible and will not let me upload a picture of Hans Deli&amp;#8217;s sign I took &amp;#8211; what I have to say about it is that it is simple, effective, and purposeful **)</description>

      <description>I started off by trying to make faces/icons in the style of the Netflix user icons.
http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/alden/sketches/ByIzAYaq-
Quickly I got bored with that so then I started trying to make patterns with simple shapes that could be optical illusions or tiled as a desktop background&amp;#8230; or a website background ðÂ I used for loops to avoid copy/pasting all my code:

      <description>For several hours after I finishedÂ Her Long Black Hair, Janet Cardiff&amp;#8217;s Central Park sound walk combining field recording, found object and narrative techniques of film noir, I felt a heightened awareness of the world around me, a sense that both the aural and visual information I was consuming had hidden narratives, meanings unknown to me, entire words and lives just beyond the field of my comprehension. This sense of hidden but pulsating alive connectivity is the central goal of Cardiff&amp;#8217;s work: to create connections within time between the walker/listener and the spaces and strangers around them, and to create connections across time, between the walker/listener, the woman with black hair, Orpheus descending into Hades to rescue Eurydice, and Cardiff herself, connecting and condensing these moments of time and myth into a gem of experiential authenticity.</description>

      <title>Akira Poster Design Analysis</title>
      <link>http://example.org/2017/09/13/48/</link>

      <guid>http://example.org/2017/09/13/48/</guid>
      <description>Visually striking and iconic* &amp;#8211; the original poster for the film Akira brings forth a sense of encroaching gloom, of decay, of violence, all with a startling minimalism. The film depicts the country of Japan at a time of crisis, evoked here in the poster by centering the colors of the Japanese flag and surrounding them with creeping, looming shadows of blue-grey.
The eye is immediately drawn by the image organization and the blue splash on his jacket toward the figure in the center, bringing him front and center to the poster and indicating that he is, if not the lead character, at least central to the film.</description>

      <description>Within ten minutes of using any screened device my left eye begins to strain and ache. My wrists hurt almost constantly and frequently I need to use wrist splints when typing in order to avoid the pain. When I go to sleep at night I have a dull ache in my neck and between my eyes, and when I wake up my first thought is to check my phone. Before thinking about coffee, before thinking about food, or work, or my day ahead, or my partner lying beside me, a light goes off in my brain, a synapse fires, indicating that it is seeking a dopamine reward for checking Twitter.</description>
